Thank you for the debate .
On the other hand it has been observed - and this cannot be denied - that the ceiling system actually <unk> those hauliers that try to adopt ecologically friendly procedures , as has been said , while instead encouraging bad practice , as you well know , and even fraudulent practices : for instance , many lorries go in with a bill of <unk> , <unk> in Austria and then leave , and so are not subject to the points clause .
Report ( <unk> / 2002 ) by <unk> <unk> McNally , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on adopting a multiannual programme for action in the field of energy : &apos; <unk> Energy for Europe &apos; Programme ( <unk> ) ( COM ( 2002 ) <unk> - <unk> / 2002 - 2002 / <unk> ( COD ) ) Transport and mobility are , today , crucial factors for the pricing of goods and services and it is , therefore , crucial that in no way do they constitute breaches of competition .
In a collective effort , the institutions of the European Union must therefore help prevent crises brought about by price increases .
The European Parliament is not the Council ’ s echo chamber .
The very extensive international safety regulations that today govern maritime transport have brought about a drastic reduction in accidents and pollution , and the measures we are debating today show the commitment of our institutions to enhancing vessel safety and the protection of the marine environment .
It does not make sense for various companies in three major EU Member States to work on the <unk> Air <unk> project , for example , in separate projects that have nothing to do with one another , and to <unk> earnings , as it were .
Economic and social progress must also lead to the consolidation of the areas of democracy , but , as has already been stressed , we must not lose sight of the fact that full respect for human rights is essential if the partnership is genuinely to succeed .
It is this responsibility that has led my group to request a separate vote on paragraphs 6 and 7 of the compromise resolution .
<unk> is not just a domestic issue .
<unk> results will emerge through development , democracy and prosperity .
In the final analysis , many remarks made in this meeting will also be of interest to Mrs <unk> Gorsel , but since she has reminded me of this question , which , as I have already said , I would have addressed at a later stage , let me just say that this is of course an issue pertaining to the internal market .
If such difficulties present themselves , I would make an appeal to you as President-designate of the Commission , Professor Prodi , please to make sure that difficulties do not become crises .
– Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to use this speech to welcome the progress made in the interinstitutional dialogue and the compromise which I believe has been reached .
I do not object ; I do not hold strong views on the subject and I certainly do not want to upset my good friend Mr <unk> , but there is a danger that we could create <unk> subjects and superior subjects .
We have to be cautious about taking on any new commitments , but , at the same time , we must stand by the commitments that we have made , once the countries fulfil the strict conditions for accession .
We have all enjoyed the discussions - sometimes very wide-ranging - we have had on it .
There was the Maastricht 3 % rule , which meant an automatic block on social issues .
We have noted Parliament &apos;s suggestion , in Paragraph 7 , on the <unk> of amending the regulations governing the financial instrument , the <unk> .
I would remind you of one of these measures : the ‘ Single Sky ’ initiative , which is going to mean a reduction in costs and better rotation of the fleet , the authorisation of alliances , the combating of distortions in competition conditions – specifically , the issue of support for our air companies in the face of <unk> or predatory practices on the part of third countries – and the support we have given them in relation to issues such as insurance when there have been difficulties in the past .
Méndez de Vigo / <unk> Report ( <unk> / 2001 ) The willingness of the rapporteur to do this was another factor that encouraged me to vote for the report .
Subject : <unk> of flax Does the Commission consider it reprehensible that <unk> officials at the Ministry of Agriculture should have encouraged practices reminiscent of <unk> hunting &apos; with regard to the cultivation of flax , promoted them through administrative channels , and received <unk> for themselves and their families as a result ?
.
A second product that warrants special attention in the light of trade and development , and which is often overlooked in the discussion of agriculture , is cotton .
The presidency has suggested that the European proposal should not go as far as requesting abolition of the death penalty but rather a moratorium on the use of this punishment .
I would like to rid certain people here of the <unk> that those who took the initiative for quorum counts are no longer present .
Mr President , I have an appeal to make to the EU Heads of State or Government when they meet in Brussels tomorrow and on Friday .
It seems then , that the rule of law prevails in Mexico .
.
Mr President , in its proposals to the Council of Ministers , the Commission has not set out the prices of products and subsidies , as it <unk> claims it has done ; in our opinion , it simply wants to remind us of the prices and subsidies which will be in force for the period from <unk> in accordance with existing regulations , and at the very most , to amend some monthly <unk> to the intervention prices of any products to which this system still applies .
I want to say once again that this is not a problem created by our staff , who work extremely hard , thin on the ground as they are .
The proposed directive on passenger registration will , I feel , remain a measure purely on record .
But I do not think we should only devote one year to this aim .
Does it want reform because of enlargement or because of the WTO ?
It is defined according to the subject of the research , which must be carried out at least at European level if it is to match up to world competition .
Mr President , I wish to support the Culture 2000 programme and congratulate the rapporteur , Mr <unk> <unk> <unk> , for having enriched the text as a whole with new contributions aimed , on the one hand , at achieving greater participation of countries and beneficiaries and , on the other , at emphasising the need to <unk> the grants , as well as recommendations in defence of the <unk> of activities and great cultural events .
I am optimistic , but such optimism depends upon maintaining the balance in the social model .
I am glad that the Mayer and Menrad reports were discussed together because this also underlines the fact that we are endeavouring to live out the social market economy and , rather than play social policy off against economic policy , consider these as complementary and common factors and establish a symbol of unity .
The Commission is now aware that the threat is real .
Poverty in the world is not on the decline , quite the opposite .
As Members of this House have stressed repeatedly , Tibetan <unk> are at particular risk .
Several pupils were seriously injured and are still undergoing treatment in hospital in <unk> and <unk> .
As happy as I am with the Commissioner &apos;s proposals , as <unk> as I am about the Barroso Commission as a whole , it is ridiculous to come up with a communication on oil without a single sentence on transport , when we all know that transport accounts for 70 % of oil consumption in Europe .
We retained the specific rule in the financial regulation in <unk> with a <unk> which we settled thus .
We quite rightly set up the WTO panel to deal with differences of interest , and I am not only referring to the interests of big countries but also to those of small countries such as Honduras , Guatemala , Mexico or <unk> , in this case - so that they can have a reference in order to be able to react to any disturbance to their markets , in particular in order to face up to the bigger countries .
It must do so again today .
Spain maintained its unity , it kept the Basque country and <unk> and Catalonia and it did well to do so , because no one identified Spain with <unk> and no one played around with Spain &apos; s unity in the name of a <unk> dictator .
That is why I have asked the ministers , since they have not given me any more money , to ensure that supplements to the Erasmus grants are offered in their countries , and this is something we are discussing .
The new system would also allow the measures to be adapted quickly , taking account of the specific features of these regions .
<unk> defending the rights of homosexuals are among the partners involved in this measure , and several initiatives have accordingly been taken , such as an information campaign and an effort to raise the public ’ s awareness of the forms of discrimination suffered by homosexuals .
At the same time , the rapporteur calls for the enforcement of a cooperative .
In a further attempt to adapt the fleet to the resources , the Commission has again forgotten that there are countries that have broadly complied with their objectives , and is presenting a global proposal which will punish everybody with the threat of new cuts in fleet size and the intention of <unk> aid for the modernisation of the fleet .
Europe has thus been able to respond to the legitimate aspirations of these people who have suffered so much under an ideology that , for forty years , refused to recognise their most basic rights .
However , I emphasise that the Council deplores any situation where human rights are not upheld .
I therefore welcome the fact that Mrs Bjerregaard has promised , in a letter to the rapporteur , that she will bring forward such a framework directive on the basis of the guidelines set out by the rapporteur , focusing on emission standards as the most appropriate instrument , combined with the principles of prevention , precaution and action at source .
The Economic and Social Committee also gave a favourable opinion on 29 October 1997 and the Council should take its final decision before the end of the first half of 1998 , during the British Presidency .
Moving on to the Ombudsman , the <unk> % implementation rate is of note .
We have seen the success of rural development programmes , including the LEADER scheme and other such activities which have helped create much needed employment in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas throughout Europe .
Such errors should therefore be classified separately from the substantial errors .
But all is not lost , for sooner or later , when the revolutionary forces come to power , a referendum will give a voice back to the people to confirm the <unk> of French law over the European treaties .
The principle of equality of opportunity and treatment between men and women is one of the philosophical foundations of our European Parliament .
After meeting her in prison in Ankara and at the time of her trial , I still remember a young woman of incredible strength and determination .
We have heard a number of stories of failed coordination which has hampered the effectiveness of that aid .
This is one of Europe &apos; s great opportunities , but digital television also plays an important role .
That is one of your core tasks as President of the Commission .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate all those involved in conciliation and achieving more for the Socrates Programme than some of us even dreamed was possible .
Despite these amendments , the objective remains the same .
I do not think we will be setting a very good example if we then fail to even discuss this issue !
I have to tell Commissioner Mandelson that this traditional attitude is a thing of the past ; today , you come to the table not with the power of military persuasion , but with ideology and the instrument of liberalisation , yet it will not work , for the countries of the developing world are now standing up for themselves , making their own interests visible and countering the intellectual property that we want to sell to them in the form of <unk> services with what is theirs culturally , socially and ecologically , along with the right to basic <unk> .
Have all the avenues been closed off whereby North Korea might be brought back to talk to the Six ?
This is the enemy which your CFSP has in its sights .
I hope that this approach will be addressed when we look at the situation <unk> all minorities .
Thirdly , we have ensured that only certain specific products may be used to manufacture gelatine and tallow , namely those which I have already described .
This is a free country , Mr <unk> .
If you want to enlarge the European Union , you have to make it fit for enlargement .
We are interested in having sound foundations so that we do not just <unk> from one problem to the next , but so that we can work together on a solid basis for years to come , because the problem in the Balkans is not a problem which can be solved in a year .
The answer , of course , is an emphatic no .
For that to happen , we need cooperation , ideas , people and capacities and those are the <unk> of the four main axes in the Framework Programme .
The other point is positive <unk> .
This is important in occupational training which <unk> people for making a professional contribution to society .
Mr President , Mrs Gebhardt , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to congratulate the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights and , more specifically , our colleague Mrs Gebhardt , for the excellent work that they have all done and the determination they showed during the conciliation procedure .
The indictment against the continuous violations of democracy and human rights perpetrated by the Iraqi regime .
Now that the good Commissioner is listening , I will continue .
The European Union has to be at the cutting edge , it has even been said this evening , but , as regards restoring the ozone <unk> in the <unk> , and similarly , controlling the greenhouse effect , the result cannot be measured on the basis of Europe &apos; s speed , but only by taking an overall view .
Watson report ( <unk> / 2001 ) Such arguments are insulting to all sponsors except the tobacco industry , who make enormous efforts to finance these competitions .
For both the <unk> and the <unk> EDF , Liberia was more or less out of the circuit .
The debate is closed .
Civil servants and politicians must always be aware that we have an impact on the ability of our companies to be profitable and to grow .
Obviously , the first type is the most common .
The fact is that the introduction of a <unk> is dependent on the interoperability of toll systems , which means that the technology must be available , and work , before we can start charging for the <unk> , and we all know how urgently we need the money .
For some twenty years now we have been unable to stop unemployment <unk> .
This phenomenon is mainly a result of the technical developments of <unk> and <unk> , which permit various types of infrastructure functioning independently of each other to transport various types of content .
If there are <unk> product companies that are incapable of distinguishing tens of thousands of tonnes of <unk> made from animal waste , oil and chemical products from real butter , how can consumers be expected to have any confidence in their ability to guarantee the quality of their own products ?
Yet I really feel we can achieve that goal , which we have been pursuing since the end of the 1960s , and I hope that the single currency will become the starting point for finally achieving political union .
Agricultural prices We are very well aware , though , that we do not have the resources for that and that we will focus solely on cross-border projects and the big priority projects .
In addition there have been European Investment Bank loans which , over the same period , came to 267 million ECU plus <unk> million ECU coming from the Member States .
If the State is now powerless and unable to regularly pay its officials , this is surely primarily because the Duma refused to adopt the tax code and buried the proposed tax system under a mountain of amendments .
Unless there is a material change in Mr Buttiglione &apos;s portfolio , we shall be obliged to vote against your Commission .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the European Commission for their lists of good intentions , which I am sure they will do everything to implement .
<unk> ! &apos;
They will hopefully be concluded by April .
<unk> and practical rules are essential because there are fifteen countries , each with its own problems and in some countries - in my own , to be precise - in which responsibilities for control in this field lie with the <unk> autonomous governments .
We are also restricted by the GATT agreements within the framework of the WTO because , as a result of a major political error , unlike agricultural products , fishery products have always been consolidated under the GATT .
That was echoed by the words of the Commissioner immediately following my contribution .
The second important point is that you have been asked to examine a text which has not been prepared by a group of experts or a group of wise men , but which has been drafted by <unk> Members of the Convention , without any options .
However , I would like to emphasise some of the elements of the debate which may be very useful for the purposes of today &apos; s debate .
The drugs problem is world-wide .
We will also be undertaking evaluations on the subjects of employment , the environment , equal opportunities and support for SMEs in response to your wishes and I hope that the evaluation methods will gradually improve both in the Member States and in the Community .
So I firmly support Mr <unk> &apos; s justified criticism !
It is all too easy to pay <unk> service to human rights .
Structural aid for the rural economy , which was developed in <unk> , was also intended to provide compensation for the agricultural interests which were sacrificed within the framework of the GATT negotiations .
One important point that we wish to emphasise is the Commission ’ s acceptance that new agencies should be established <unk> and <unk> .
We must be tougher in our demands for progress in the direction set in Doha , in order to bring about greater openness in the markets , which will stimulate world trade .
That is especially important if our fellow MEPs from the new Member States are to receive reasonable salaries and if the earnings gap is to be reduced between those who earn least and those who earn most .
In this way we can discourage repetition in future .
We need systems to <unk> out pornography , and also racist and violent content ; I should like to see these particular filters for adults , too .
It is gratifying that the European Economic and Trade Office has been set up in Taiwan , something which I think indicates that the EU wants to see increased cooperation .
Secondly , Mr Pittella who , as a new member , came to the committee and has made quite a significant point about the <unk> of the ECSC funds .
I am very <unk> to be a member of Parliament ’ s delegation to that review conference .
However , I simply cannot understand why the Council did not accept Parliament &apos;s formulations on one matter , and that was the derogations for farmers .
We have already agreed this in the case of the electronic and electrical waste directive .
It would also be important to have a European day against human trafficking .
Because we now need to do more and better with the available resources – which seems to be the theme for today – I therefore call on the Commission to get the allocation of the scarce resources right and to invest in projects based on the fundamental principles of lasting peace and regional stability , respect for human rights and democracy , and sustainable development .
The <unk> amount of work placed on those in the field means that the EU &apos;s money is not accurately and fully <unk> .
I will leave it for others to judge whether they merit that description .
I hope that everyone can contribute to such a solution .
The euro has proved its worth even before its actual introduction .
We have also made a conscious effort to get young candidates onto the list .
Our determination has enabled the Community preferential arrangements and aid to Union producers , who have long been in line with social and environmental standards , to be respected .
The signatories have frequently requested that the applicants for membership submit plans and programmes in which precise time schemes and goals for the bringing into force of the individual items of legislation are indicated .
.
Mr President , having lived most of my life under Communist rule , the rules we are enforcing in the ‘ Television without <unk> ’ Directive sound all too familiar to me .
Although slavery was officially abolished fifty years ago , it continues to exist in all kinds of forms : people are <unk> and sold like commodities , are employed in forced labour , receive very little pay and are <unk> in their freedom of movement .
They are all fine ideas , but fine ideas with no money to back them up are nothing but empty promises .
The Commission proposes to consolidate and modernise the present procurement directives .
How can we refuse others what we granted ourselves after the war , to reconstruct our industry , agriculture and economy ?
Why , therefore , do we not have legislation which identifies what integrated production is by means of a quality mark ?
To conclude , what we are trying to do is to ensure that the EU maintains its position as the world leader in mobile telephony .
Unfortunately this is all too true , but we must guard this stable door effectively now .
.
Madam President , allow me to say how <unk> it is to see you in this position .
We are left with Article 11 ( 1 ) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States .
Finally , a constitution <unk> who is responsible for what .
Unfortunately , he has not kept this promise .
It has been proposed that financial instruments be organised alongside those of the nation states , and that is something we cannot do without , but it is equally clear that people like Europeans , from a highly mobile society , cannot do without <unk> help in such a situation .
Given the fact that the final decision on <unk> has not been taken yet , the flexibility in <unk> funds between <unk> and other fusion activities is an important element of the proposal .
Those arguing that such an action should take place would have to consider the undesirable consequences arising from it .
At any rate , the ECU <unk> m under the old programme were well invested between 1992 and 1996 in projects involving 16 international transport axes - incentives which allowed demand to grow .
No wonder they are not <unk> at the chance to become involved with the International Criminal Court .
I ask this , in particular , because a series of recent food scandals , from mad cow disease to dioxin in chickens , has shown that food safety and the quest for profit are a contradiction in terms .
Today , it is a reform of the CAP and Community trade policy and therefore , implicitly , the fisheries policy .
Resumption of the session The Swedish Conservatives have today chosen to abstain in the vote on the Citizens for Europe report .
I am glad that we can debate the matter properly here and I thank the rapporteur for his detailed report .
And my fifth point is that we finally need to return to disarmament .
Mr President , the atmosphere has changed significantly since the visit of George <unk> Bush to Brussels a few months ago , but it is interesting that in the international press this is not yet recognised .
The public service broadcasters are our guarantee of free communication , of high quality , accessible to all , and respecting cultural diversity .
But this <unk> approach means that passengers are running growing risks .
Nevertheless , can I ask you to confirm that it is quite inappropriate for Members of this House - Liberals or otherwise - to seek to persuade you to hear them .
Obviously , some operators are driven to resort to longer buses by the <unk> of competition .
<unk> from my constituency believe that industrial fishing is one of the main causes of this state of affairs : both because the smaller fish on which they feed are being taken in huge quantities and because the <unk> themselves are being caught in the very small <unk> nets necessary for industrial fishing , as indeed are <unk> <unk> cod .
Let me conclude with one comment .
That is the reason .
However , the Presidency hopes that Mr <unk> will soon return to the European Parliament for further discussions .
Some complex questions , such as deposit guarantee schemes or the issue of <unk> of last resort , must be <unk> in that context .
To the traceability of the animal , it would be appropriate , Madam President , to add the guarantee that the animal has always been fed on grass or cereals .
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves .
It is there that the new challenge lies following the failure of Lisbon .
I have no more to say on the subject , save to pay tribute to my officials who have tried to implement a difficult policy honestly , transparently and with integrity .
Mr President , I rise to speak in place of my colleague and fellow member of the Petitions Committee Mr <unk> , who is , regrettably , unable to be present .
I see the focus on health education and food security in our programme in Angola as something which will be useful for precisely this endeavour .
My question to you is : has the Bureau looked into this matter yet ?
On the other hand , being obliged to use it and still having to wait minutes on end to get out , I do not see the reasons for this .
I am fully aware that the Vietnam debate is historically charged .
I voted for the report which approves the entry of the Slovak Republic into the European Union too , and I hope that the next European Parliament , elected in 2004 , will include at least one representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party of the Slovak Republic , so that there will be more of us to protect the interests of the elderly throughout Europe .
The position of <unk> in some countries , for example , needs to be addressed , and here we hope to see practical improvements .
It can become a larger and stronger political entity if we get on with the homework that now awaits us .
At the same time , an optimistic atmosphere prevailed in Africa , because Africa had far greater resources than the Asian countries .
Thus far , its response has been promising .
In addition , paragraph 11 of the report welcoming the commitment by the European Central Bank to the ratification of the so-called European Constitution is an insult , given that it was recently voted down by the peoples of France and the Netherlands .
In summary , an agreed overall solution between all institutions is within reach if the European Parliament tomorrow accepts Amendments Nos 9 , 13 , 18 , 25 , 26 , 28 , 37 , 38 and 44 to 50 .
As unemployment appears during structural reforms , support is needed , but one cannot devote all one &apos;s attention to support alone , as otherwise the budget cannot be sustained .
Subject : Measures to protect chocolate As part of its policy to ensure the quality of agricultural products and foodstuffs , the Union has set up a system to protect traditional products of specific character , under which chocolate is eligible for recognition .
As your report makes clear , there is an urgent need to review both the organization and the functioning of the Commission &apos;s services and , more generally , the system for preparing and taking decisions .
I have also been thinking about other matters .
It always seems to be a matter of <unk> , we may have had some irregularities , there may have been some <unk> of fraud but we do not have to pay all the money back &apos; .
Either way , the operators and the regulatory authorities have a duty to see proper financial provision is made for the costs of decommissioning .
We held meetings with members of the <unk> Government , with parliamentary leaders , with the President of Congress , and with President Lula &apos;s principal <unk> , and we realised once again that we are dealing here with an extraordinary country , which is setting in motion an exemplary social inclusion programme , which will be crucial to its future .
EURES has an important role for them and it is a great pity that employment and employers &apos; organisations are not more involved in the development of these services .
However , to focus on the European Union as it is today , and on the subject of government and governance - a word which , at least in Spanish , brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs , although it may be an appropriate word anyway - , the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government , and , since President Prodi always <unk> his home town , Bologna , I would advise him to go to <unk> for a while and see something which we all understand : the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which speak of <unk> <unk> &#91; good government &#93; and <unk> <unk> &#91; bad government &#93; .
The next item is the Council statement on the annual report on human rights followed by a debate .
The Council should be aware of the fact that a new level of cooperation now exists between the two bodies responsible for budgetary matters .
I am sure that none of us here will object to fraud and tax evasion being tackled but I must say that it is necessary to maintain the confidence of citizens in the Union , and I think that many Member State governments will be wishing to look very carefully at any extension of <unk> before agreeing to it .
Any attempt to explain life in the community of <unk> in the <unk> of England to the rest of the European Union and beyond without mentioning <unk> would give a very false impression of the importance of <unk> to that city and , indeed , to the motor car industry within the European Union .
This new programme <unk> various objectives .
I hope the European Commission will consider using this report as the basis for what could be called &apos;the first European action plan on dementia &apos; .
All that remains is for me to express my <unk> appreciation of all citizens and governments who have , so <unk> and <unk> , contributed towards financing humanitarian actions to help the devastated peoples .
The current difficulties and limitations of the system of excise duty and VAT , necessarily geared towards harmonisation among the Member States , must be overcome so that a real single market can be launched .
Following Portugal &apos; s <unk> Revolution &apos; , when I arrived for the first time at the United Nations in 1974 as Minister for Foreign Affairs , the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs said to me , &apos; <unk> careful , do not <unk> <unk> , because <unk> is not a <unk> and never has been . &apos;
Mr President , if the failure of Seattle really were to lead to a standstill or slow down the trade integration processes at global level , it would be a disaster .
In France these small companies , which number 800 000 , are currently the best job <unk> .
Like you , we are in favour of having transmission obligations .
Denmark will no doubt benefit from a successful start to the third stage of EMU .
In fact Parliament &apos;s support for and contribution to the reform has been crucial .
Today , I am disappointed by the poor results achieved .
Mr President , Commissioner , please excuse me for not being present when you called my question .
We heard Mr Santer &apos;s commitment to carrying through the requests in the motion for a resolution .
Secondly , these agreements can provide an opportunity for both parties to improve their respective procedures and even their legislation .
In other words , if a general obligation is defined , the States can do what they want , and essentially place a ceiling on compensation payments paid to workers .
However , we firmly believe that the European Regional Development Fund should be phased out and the money returned to the Member States .
To my mind , the greatest inadequacy of the Council &apos;s common position is the lack of sufficient control in implementing the indicative limit values .
This is taken up in the Souchet report and my own , with specific reference , in both cases , to Community action in the context of international organizations defining future changes in international maritime law .
Far , too , from filling the <unk> of the people who live there , it has driven them into debt and has failed to solve the problem of famine .
The first type covers two activity reports : one from the <unk> Committee on Safety , <unk> and Health Protection at Work , and the other from the Safety and Health Commission for the <unk> and Other <unk> <unk> .
They are exempt from basic training , which prevents them from becoming unemployed and are only obliged to undergo further training every five years .
Perhaps I should try to take the wind out of the <unk> &apos; <unk> .
Even though we have to admit that a number of points have been taken on board , matters are as unsatisfactory as ever they were .
Europe is not at the moment at a disadvantage but the situation is moving rapidly .
It says that the funding was increased in 1996 , that the Commission presented proposals to the Florence European Council for the funding of the 14 priority projects , and that the preliminary draft budget for 1997 provides for an increase in the appropriations for the trans-European networks .
This is nothing new !
We are only too aware of the consequences this has on women &apos;s health .
This is essentially a new approach , one that requires constant emphasis .
This European Union is about a vision for the future .
It is highly hypocritical that the nine old Member States who are not lifting their restrictions are allowing the entry of workforce from non-European Union countries , but refuse to allow entry to workers from the new Member States .
Finally , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her stimulating report and to stress the Commission &apos;s determination to maintain its efforts to overcome the problems faced by frontier workers .
Why is that not so in the case of the Structural Funds ?
I have to say that I was not totally satisfied by the Commissioners &apos; responses , in that the documents that were referred to , with which we are familiar , as Mr Pronk said , need to contain time frames and rather more practical decision .
The patent recently issued to the University of Edinburgh poses the problem of the status of the <unk> and how to control it .
The study was carried out under the very clear influence of industrial groups , car manufacturers and oil <unk> , and , as such , there cannot be much technical confidence in the measures proposed in it .
I therefore feel that the matter should be examined in full .
This increase in miles <unk> the profit gained from using an economical and clean engine .
Perhaps your lack of interest in our Parliament , not to say your <unk> , <unk> from the fact that you have never been a Member of Parliament , you have never been elected , which means the people have never given you any mandate .
We represent the citizens and it is very useful that we are all in agreement .
<unk> , when Spain stopped looking towards Europe , she turned in upon herself and became <unk> , and a long process of civil conflicts began , creating the image of the two <unk> in the eyes of the world .
In your opinion , how many unnecessary administrative obstacles are there in EU regulations ?
In conclusion , the Commission accepts the new recital 3 , and I hope that this directive can now be finalised .
The Budgets Council did not , therefore , make its decisions exclusively on the basis of the priorities set by the Council ; it also took into account the budgetary principles I have just outlined .
When there is this level of organisation , it is no longer simply a question of combating illegal immigration , but of properly fighting crime itself .
President-in-Office of the Council , do you consider it appropriate to adopt measures to prevent sexual harassment in the <unk> <unk> ?
It is more than airlines : the European tourism industry is Europe &apos;s biggest industry , and the World <unk> and Tourism Council estimates at the present time that two million jobs could be lost in Europe .
All this is <unk> advice .
Mr President , all instances of racism and xenophobia , both old and new , are utterly <unk> , as we all agree .
When they meet for negotiations next week , the agricultural ministers will hopefully realise that a poor decision , or no decision at all , may in actual fact lead to a disaster for farmers , the countryside and also consumers who want to see good food in Europe .
There is a legal basis for industry , but there is no legal basis for tourism which , in a few years &apos; time , will be the most important sector in industry .
Let me also point out that the results of the process of transformation that we have already seen in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have varied to a wide degree .
Then you <unk> find we &apos;re on your side !
These issues have nothing to do with the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol into Community law .
If everyone is clear what foundations we are working from , then enterprises will have a smaller administrative burden and governments will not need to compete for rates indiscriminately .
The red tape here is minimal .
Furthermore , I believe it would be just as wrong to present compliance with the Stability Pact objectives as being a sufficient or , worse still , the only possible reaction to a context with a clear risk of recession .
Nevertheless , the West , the International Monetary Fund , the European Union and G7 continued to support to the so-called <unk> &apos; which showed signs of inefficiency for years , though these went <unk> by the West , <unk> by <unk> fundamentalism .
<unk> / 97 by Mr <unk> , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on : I. the recommendation for second reading on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a Council Regulation on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies ( <unk> / <unk> / <unk> ( SYN ) ) and II .
the report on the proposal for a Council regulation on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure ( <unk> / 2 / 97 - <unk> / 96-96 / <unk> ( CNS ) ) and - <unk> / 97 by Mrs Randzio-Plath , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , on the economic policy of the Member States of the Community ( COM ( 97 ) <unk> - <unk> / 97 ) If the institutions are to be successfully reformed , which is vital if our citizens are to have confidence in the way in which they are run , it is a problem , as Mr Blak has said , that nobody seems to wish to take responsibility .
At the moment , the sums we failed to get from the third package are equal to half the money which my country spends on education and health .
The human rights included in the Charter are powerful ones .
In this light , I would like to reopen the debate on corporate governance to discuss the wider concept of the company as stakeholders society , including the role of both sides of industry and all parties involved .
However , since he is not here , the question lapses .
The joint debate is closed .
We should instead carry on talking .
We need a permanent solution .
It is also unfair to accuse Members , who genuinely believe that the legal basis for this proposal is wrong , of being under the control of cigarette manufacturers .
Sometimes travellers need additional support and perhaps more support than the local population .
It also calls for a specific action programme , with effect from the 2005 budget .
Because many pensioners are worried and cannot sleep either .
That is what led the Commission to propose , in September 1997 , a legislative framework , based on Article 95 of the Treaty , with the aim of harmonising the procedures applying to <unk> trials in the European Union .
We must , however , make sure that the rules are designed in such a way as to provide adequate protection against the spread of <unk> to , in the first place , areas that are free of the disease .
Human dignity , respect for animals and plants within God &apos;s creation remain important issues to discuss .
The first stage of that process will , as indicated in the report , be a formal consultation of the social partners .
It is therefore possible to find a substantial sum of money for the Balkans without revising the financial perspectives .
There can be no point in sending young <unk> Europeans to developing countries , especially those experiencing catastrophic circumstances , just to help Europe &apos;s unemployment figures .
These requirements will be subject to mutual evaluation by the Member States and the Commission .
They were among 49 passengers denied <unk> because of airline regulations on crew shortage after a crew member had to be taken to hospital .
I wish to begin by giving special thanks to Karl von Wogau for his involvement in this process over the last 22 years .
The result is reasonably good .
– Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , at this late hour , I shall begin with a story about a driver who asks the price of a drop of petrol at a petrol station .
Some charges have been brought , which the Danish police have investigated .
Looking objectively at the text which is now before us , I think it tries to strike a fair balance between those who wish to go further and those who oppose any research whatsoever , between the technical and the ethical .
We must , of course , ask ourselves the question : what does accession cost ?
The reform of the common agricultural policy is very controversial .
That concludes Question Time .
An examination of the official documents shows an inconsistency and a lack of coordination of many Community policies with regard to the objective to strengthen cohesion .
A Member of this House did so referring to the situation in the Basque country .
In Eurodac , almost ten years later , we have an instrument that makes possible the clear identification of asylum-seekers and also of illegal immigrants .
That is , after all , the aim of the directive : to identify procedures which ensure a high degree of safety , while at the same time avoiding imposing an unnecessary burden of bureaucracy on the industry concerned .
Here too , I am repeating myself and merely saying what has already been said , but we must again lay stress on one fact .
The Presidency endeavoured to learn the lessons of this crisis and take a long hard look at the future .
The Commission should simply accept the amendments and proceed accordingly .
My primary objective has been to ensure that there is value for money for the European taxpayer and a desire to maintain the reputation and the dignity of this House in the eyes of the European public .
<unk> should not be able to use such substances as part of temporary additives to animal feed .
The goal , although perhaps too <unk> defined , is the right one .
Mr <unk> spoke about the French lorry blockade , UK <unk> farmers and the problems in Ireland .
I live in the middle of the forest in Sweden and should scarcely dare come home at all if some <unk> <unk> had got the idea that I had banned <unk> hunting .
Anyway , the European Union must do whatever is possible from a political and community point of view , and the resolution bears witness to this .
That happens far too little at the moment .
It also comes at a time when many Members of the House were giving favourable consideration to extending the Cotonou Convention to include Cuba .
Today , in Parliament , about 2 % of Members may not speak their mother tongue .
A budget geared towards development is therefore extremely important for the common European future .
Those are two quite simple objectives .
There is no intrinsic value in this .
Those are concepts that unite the Member States of the European Union .
I would therefore ask the President-in-Office once again to consider whether we should not meet the wishes of the opposition in Burma and introduce sanctions against the illegal junta which is now occupying the government .
This does not mean <unk> the importance of EU enlargement and the stabilisation of the Balkans ; it simply means that the Rio process must not suffer the same fate as the Barcelona process or the policies on the Mediterranean .
By the way - and I am sure even you have got wind of this - the Austrian Presidency seems to have acquired the kind of reputation that goes with the <unk> , ‘ the <unk> meal ’ .
It even insisted on the implementation of the education agreement concluded between Mr Milosevic and Mr <unk> without delay .
In the United States , there were plans to apply certain filters , but these blocked all the information on breast cancer , for example , because the word ‘ breast ’ was banned as <unk> and all the information on it was filtered out .
I want to state resolutely and unequivocally that we consider cooperation with the <unk> to be in the interest of all of us living in what was once Yugoslavia .
In the meantime , however , the experience of , and the lessons learned to date from , <unk> II are being actively considered by the Commission in the context of a review of its overall strategy in this field .
It was then a country with huge energy shortages , tremendous <unk> , Soviet troops still on its soil and tremendous insecurity .
We need to work with the United States to make that a reality .
I agree that third countries should set their own health rules but we should not approve of double standards .
To conclude , Mr President , I wish to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the results it has achieved , on the compromise reached between Council and Parliament , in which the Commission played a part and which should , we hope , enable this dossier to be concluded at first reading .
The compromise on <unk> is realistic giving a <unk> breathing space before a full ban would be introduced .
Similarly , controlling the activities of EU armaments companies will inevitably be compromised by the uncontrolled licensing of production outside the EU .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , well , those of you who are still here , I think that as we are amongst experts , there are only a few key points to make about the budget for Parliament for the year 2000 .
( IT ) Mr President , the oral amendment seeks to replace the word &quot; qualification &quot; , the last word in the amendment , with the word &quot; expertise &quot; .
This report says , for instance , that parents with children in <unk> are people with reduced mobility .
We have tabled a number of amendments , and if , as I really believe will be the case , it is not possible for these to be supported by Parliament , we shall find it difficult to support the report as a whole .
The European Union does indeed have such an advantage , compared , for example , with NATO .
Such awareness is understandable within the European Union and it is therefore important to have this opportunity to put forward suggestions aimed at preventing it from occurring .
I am also stepping up monitoring activities in the field of media pluralism and will shortly publish a working paper on that issue .
I presume we are expected to work out the Council &apos;s view on these matters by some form of <unk> .
I do not think I have ever come across such a fine exercise in <unk> in a public document .

Anyone reading the ICAT protocols of the past few years will come to the sad conclusion that it is the EU Member States with large fleets in the Atlantic that are <unk> a preventive approach in the ICAT committees by <unk> any decisions on more stringent management measures to protect young fish .
I think that the Commission will have achieved something very commendable if it moves in that direction and if it considers it appropriate , as seems to me quite apparent , to seek the cooperation of all of the associations in that category , in an effort to collect the most wide-ranging and detailed documentation possible .
At the same time , however , long-standing prejudices and ideas about the participation of women in the creation and development of our society must be swept aside .
It emphasises the need for personal responsibility as well as economic responsibility at lower levels of the official machinery .
We are not in a position to make a judgment from our own knowledge and experience , and as Mr Patten has just said , we have agreed that the International Criminal Tribunal will be the <unk> on this issue and we do have a clear picture at present .
The Commission has demonstrated its concern about this matter in the report .
We shall nonetheless be voting against the report as a whole in the light of the subsidiarity principle .
In the present situation it is crucial that the European Union and the international community leave no doubt about their resolve .
To close , what is really important , and I take it on board and will promote it in the Commission , is the question of collating data , really accurate data which will give us the real dimension of the difference between the sexes in the health sector ; this will of course help both us and the Member States to plan the rest of our strategy .
Nevertheless , every opportunity should be taken for bilateral and <unk> talks .
We have here a well-balanced , excellent report on a subject which , together with the directive on <unk> cars and <unk> drafted earlier by Mr Florenz , will from now on serve as a model for other similar legislation .
But do you not think it would be a very good thing if the brain had a body , and arms and legs ?
So , from one member of a group of one to another member of a group of one , let me say : congratulations .
The transparency of the aid redistribution procedures must also be increased .
Therefore , even if an agreement is not reached with the Council , could you explain to me how it is that there is a risk of certain organisations not having funding ?
The Commission is nonetheless aware of the fact that legislative action must be backed up by other initiatives aimed at combating de facto discrimination , humiliating practices , prejudice and <unk> .
We have to show them that enlargement will bring much greater benefits for everyone .
The debate is closed .
Not least , dialogue with and support for those countries from which the immigrants come and those through which they pass on their way to Europe are absolutely essential for any lasting , effective solution .
We need to restore the competitiveness of the railway system , which is possible in the light of the analysis proposed , but naturally we cannot just consider the railway system and railway transportation ; we also need to take other means into account , the role this competitiveness can play in trade and in combined transportation and , naturally , how the various means of transport are integrated .
After listening to all the statements it is clear that there is a wide variety of opinion in Parliament .
The debate is closed .
We ask Europe to become more involved .
I would like to say to the rapporteur that he is absolutely right , that the effectiveness of all these measures will be assessed according to the Member States &apos; capacity for control in their various areas of responsibility .
What I am getting at is that it would not only be wrong to express a desire to lift the arms embargo , but that it is also wrong to say at all that there is at present any question of doing so .
The credibility of the European Union is , of course , vital .
Amendment No 12 seeks to introduce a specific definition of credit .
I would like to repeat that we have not stopped aid to the Palestinian people , as some have said .
I have asked for environmental and sustainable development targets to be properly taken into consideration , and for access of SMEs to new communications and information technologies to be promoted .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is faced with a real operational problem .
But it is certainly not going to help <unk> jobs in coal and steel .
Like all those MEPs on the list to ask questions I was at least expecting a written answer immediately afterwards .
Apart from cheap loans , which the Commissioner has already mentioned , I think we need to do more to ensure the money flows quickly .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , although we support the majority of the 2002 budget guidelines , namely those that give priority to food safety and the BSE crisis and some general measures on immigration , unfortunately , the resolution is guilty of abuses that our group cannot accept because they are detrimental to the interests of farmers .
With regard to the preparation of the Barcelona European Council , specific action needs to be taken before the end of the year - we must establish the Food Safety Agency , make progress on Community patents , reach agreement on cross-border payments in euro and on public contracts , as well as implement the Galileo project .
The next item is the report ( <unk> / 2003 ) by Robert J. E. Evans , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , concerning the prevention and control of trafficking in human organs and tissues .
I have not read this morning &apos; s papers yet , but I believe I can make a sincere case to promote French beef in general .
I am sure that the Italian Presidency will do its utmost to keep this region at the top of the Union &apos;s priorities .
This concern also meets with the approval of the Group of Socialist MEPs , who have therefore voted in favour of the report , although they have substantial reservations about the statements made under item 8 . .
– Mr President , the construction of trans-European transport and energy networks is of enormous significance for the EU , and in particular for the 10 new Member States .
It was high time provision was made for bringing into line national laws dealing with legal guarantee systems ( as opposed to commercial guarantees ) in connection with contracts of sale concluded with consumers .
Secondly .
– Mr President , it is lamentable that the suffering of the people of Zimbabwe is turning into a never-ending story .
That is why the Commission will , this very afternoon , set up a special committee on risk capital , with a view to the 1998 Cardiff European Council , which will , therefore , play a fully complementary role .
Nevertheless , both the rationale underlying the organisation of these summits and the views of many of the peaceful demonstrators remain current .
It is important to establish transparency for consumers where such a mark is concerned .
And we need to tell them as much again and again .
Lastly , I should like to thank Mrs Gebhardt again for the work she has done .
This is an extremely important area , and must also be included in a <unk> healthcare system .
The Council wants to follow the subsidiarity principle and leave this in the competence of the Member States .
This will encourage our partners to follow this same line , yet without forgetting each of their priorities and specific restrictions .
The balance is such that no-one was really satisfied : a compromise which for some went much too far and for others not nearly far enough .
I intend to continue to fight for the retention of duty-free but I am intrigued by part of the response you gave my colleagues and I should like clarification .
Modern , technically advanced district heating is part of the solution , and it may also be combined with what is known as <unk> electricity production .

In comparison with the current year , we will see the greatest increase in the 2005 Budget in the agricultural budget , which will rise from EUR 44 billion to EUR 50 billion next year .
And my last question is what decisions have been taken by the Commission or the Council on sending a sufficient number of observers to Rwanda to ensure that reintegration does not lead to the silent extinction of returning refugees .
Voting will take place tomorrow at noon .
On the contrary , we must say <unk> &apos; to combating violence and terrorism if it originates in Chechnya , but &apos;No &apos; to war on the Chechen people .
The euro gives us access to a positive scenario of competitiveness , but forces us to keep a watchful eye on those who may have more difficulties .
<unk> do not see any shame in this .
We need other jobs , too , and that means that we also have to think of the bottom end of the labour market , that we have to tackle the informal economy , and so on .
On the contrary , it would be much wiser to <unk> our social security expenses without <unk> the social structure .
Lithuania , I repeat , has had its share of adventure , as we all have .
The Lisbon process is bound to fail if we do not create a unified and flexible labour market .
But are you also concerning yourselves with the safety of us sailors who work on the ships ? &quot;
The <unk> and audit scheme will be an incentive .
In this regard , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that we must be very aware of what we are facing .
What actually prevents us from widening this right and also giving it to Parliament &apos;s rapporteurs and others ?
Madam President , my colleague and friend Mr <unk> used the term <unk> deficit &apos; when referring to the Government of Equatorial Guinea in terms of democracy and human rights .
I believe that the European Parliament has delivered what my own parliament in Westminster would not .
May I conclude by thanking Parliament again most warmly for the great deal of work it has done ; I promise that we shall continue to keep Parliament informed of further preparations of the enlargement process and look forward to more debates both in committee and in the plenary .
We should try to analyse when a new approach directive can be used vis-à-vis old approach directives .

The technology for chemical weapons <unk> to Baghdad .
The compromise arrived at in the Committee on Budgets on this resolution seems to me to be going in the right direction .
A positive choice of an EU institution thereby perhaps requires - especially if we bear in mind of the negative attitude towards taxation within the Union - a negative decision at the national or global level .
The most rapidly ratified agreement was the agreement with Tunisia , which was signed in July 1995 , and which came into force in March 1998 ; it therefore took just under three years .
The great <unk> questions that so <unk> some of our Member States , such as a percentage point here or there on their voting weights in the Council , can only be resolved at 4 a. m. on Sunday , 14 December , by the top <unk> .

I would like to express my deep solidarity with this group of Cuban women in their <unk> fight for the liberation of all political prisoners .

Three amendments where we can agree with the rapporteur are Nos 2 , 8 and 9 - some of which seek to tighten up the regulations to include vehicles greater than <unk> half tonnes that carry passengers , to increase the frequency of testing and to ensure the removal from our roads of vehicles that do not conform to the <unk> regulations .
This is of course a compromise , but when we consider that a few months ago , there was still a great deal of resistance in many Member States to the common position , I would say that we have achieved something .
Financial compensation is essential to the very existence of services of general interest .
Madam President , the fact is , as Mr <unk> and Mrs <unk> said , there is a lot left to do .
We are with those who resist and with those who demand the immediate withdrawal of occupying forces .
We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens , about public debates .
At the same time , it provides for appropriate monitoring and control to exclude unacceptable distortions of competition in the market .
It is of course galling for me that it is a liberal government that is receiving the praise , but the truth has to be told : you have managed well , Mr <unk> <unk> .
A key challenge identified at the European Council was in the services sector , which remains highly fragmented .
However , I have to say that we are still faced with a procedural problem that is difficult to accept in democratic terms : establishing whether the Council thinks there is a legal basis for the method it wishes to use for channelling the revenue to the participating members which are not in breach of the rules , in other words excluding the opting-out countries and the countries paying the <unk> or <unk> .
Those have been my comments .
I believe that , whilst it has work to do to comply with the Copenhagen criteria , Turkey belongs in Europe .
I think that is also the will of the governments .
All the arguments speak in favour of biofuels : abandoning excessive dependence , greater benefits for the environment , and an increase in the sources of income available to rural firms .
Citizens ’ complaints must be dealt with rapidly and effectively , and the Ombudsman should therefore be supported in his efforts to encourage the European institutions to deal with complaints more speedily .
The Member States can incorporate it if they wish .
In Germany , they are categorically forbidden to work .
If one looks at the financial crises that are occurring all over the world , the widening gap between rich and poor and the growing number of environmental problems , there is good reason to take heed .
They are not listening to us , because we are not credible .
But let those who want to work here on a Friday do so in peace and quiet .
Indeed , if we add the two Members who have declared themselves , then the result of the vote would be <unk> At that time , this applied to half of Europe ; now we must develop it for all of Europe .
This , however , would not be compatible with the principle of subsidiarity .
In the medium term , I can tell you that the situation over the next twenty years will vary from country to country , but it will mean an extra 2 % to 7 % increase in government deficit , depending on the characteristics of each country .
There are many good forms of agriculture and we must identify them and support them , especially if we want to introduce this issue into the CAP .
I am able , in this Assembly , to say that the old Danish proverb applies here about selling <unk> by the metre and , as my fellow countrymen know , that is something which only people of a very <unk> character can do .
This policy is opposed to the interests of the consumer , the environment , high-quality production and the developing world .
It will be possible to carry out experiments and to develop European standards which we are so looking forward to .
<unk> the labour market more adaptable and flexible is leading to mass poverty .
This is not because we do not agree with it , but because it does not include synthetic alcohol and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not found a legal basis to be able to include it .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs <unk> <unk> Müller for her patience with me for making her job a lot more difficult than it might otherwise have been .
As I said in my statement on Moldova , we have sought in many respects to give priority to that country in our neighbourhood policy .
If it is the latter , then it is my clear view that citizens and voters in referenda will see through the <unk> .
– Mr President , I am in favour of establishing a separate , active and independent European Institute for Gender Equality .
However , no presidency has really begun until its programme of priorities has been launched before the European Parliament .
But today it is no longer possible to speak in an abstract way about this topic , because Europe is yet again faced with a situation which , if precautions are not taken in time , might show a repetition of the <unk> of an ethnic conflict .
According to the terms of the Treaties , the primary goal of the European Central Bank is to define monetary policy in Europe and to ensure price stability through monetary policy .
Have you done anything in this direction for the <unk> <unk> to reopen ?
It would enhance the competitiveness of the EU .
I understand that reaching a consensus in the UN is almost impossible , but sanctions coordinated with the United States , and perhaps Canada , might bring about the necessary outcome .
Are Member States &apos; <unk> plans sufficient to accommodate the additional volume of traffic ?
On the media aspect of the budget , we are disappointed that there has been no agreement from the Council on the film guarantee fund and we hope that an opportunity will be found later to reinstate this money when a legal base has been secured .
Do such facts not give us more room to manoeuvre than those that we use to significantly <unk> the tone when faced with the irresponsible attitude of the current head of the Israeli government ?
As one MEP said , aid is twice as valuable when it is offered promptly .
However , the problems that have come to light and which are as yet unresolved , are something else altogether .
I got the message very well , Mr Wynn .
People can adhere to a faith , but are not allowed to organise themselves to any serious degree .
The tourism industry in Europe was extremely hard hit in the past year following 11 September .
Let me conclude by saying that I rejoice to be able to vote on this resolution , which itself demonstrates how well the Commission and our Parliamentary committees can work together to meet the expectations of Europe &apos;s citizens .
With such a structure , individual ethnic groups can enjoy a certain measure of independence and , in my view , this is a country which can only be governed <unk> as a federation .

Let me sum up : despite the technical nature of your report , Mr <unk> , it is a very important document that will help to secure the long-term functioning of the common market in the European Union .
However , the focus on energy efficiency will be continued in all Member States through their national action plans and this is extremely important .
What has caused this increase in government expenditure ?
Or does the Spanish Government have no opinion on this ?
At this point I would like to see the EU implement those matters that are referred to in the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty but I would not like it to go beyond that or to call on the Commission to do so either .
I think that here , the Commission should demonstrate , with some form of <unk> / <unk> impact analysis , how the successful introduction of Basel II can be guaranteed .
We are going to reform the Stability Pact not because its internal logic has failed , nor the ideas underpinning it , but rather for the simple reason that too many countries have failed to comply with its terms , notably the larger countries .
Mr President , we fully support the idea that this House should summon up the moral and political resolve to set its affairs in order where necessary .
Some Members of the House - including the last questioner - have drawn attention to the importance of retaining this aid and preserving jobs in tobacco growing .

Although I do not agree with the rapporteur on all the details contained in it , I consider it important that its central concern is to aim for proportional representation in all Member States of the Union .
I therefore think that it is better to wait until after the registration period to consider whether it is desirable to redistribute the allocated areas between the Member States , rather than <unk> around with the distribution at this stage .
Only an atmosphere of trust can do that , which this House can help to build .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the reports produced and the questions asked have given me many ideas and I would like to thank the two rapporteurs and all the authors of the other documents debated today .
This is a danger with regard to the environment .

It is unacceptable for the good to be punished along with the bad .

Although discussions with staff representatives are not yet concluded , the Commission wishes to emphasise that as examination of all relevant figures will show - and the relevant figures are in the documents that I have circulated today and in the document adopted by the Commission on 18 July - the increase in yearly expenditure under Heading 5 generated by Commission reform will be modest and temporary .

We cannot , then , take certain things - all of which are important but have nothing to do with the criteria as such - as reasons for now naming a date for negotiations with Turkey , even though the criteria have in no way been met !
Or are we going to leave that all up to the Convention ?
We are calling for the abolition of the system whereby the Chief Executive is chosen by a committee made up of about 800 Hong Kong residents selected by Beijing .
That is essential , especially in the context of the globalization of the economy .

And from Barcelona to Seville , Mr Aznar , a general strike was called .
I must make a most heartfelt request to the Council and Commission , however , to find out if these rumours and accusations are indeed relevant , and how force can be more effectively <unk> .
In the same spirit , the Council needs to approve the European Parliament ’ s new statute rather than standing in its way .
Where the funding is concerned , it may be pointed out that EUR 65 million is not to be <unk> at , and it is one more item in the long list of programmes interfering with the EU &apos;s administrative procedure .
Freedom does not mean that anyone can do anything they like , it is not the result of ethical indifference ; on the contrary , it is the consequence of religion and moral conscience .
We must of course force those who are dragging their <unk> to turn this conference on climate change into a success , as well as show that we are credible when it comes to taking action too .
That was why , when the Intergovernmental Conference was coming up , we clearly came out in favour of the <unk> &apos; of these matters .
One regards medicinal products for human use and the other regards veterinary medicinal products .
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament .
I am not being <unk> : these are the words of the Italian Minister for the Interior .
My impression , Mr President , is that this first reading is going to produce a text typical of these Community institutions : a kind of <unk> – that is , a horse designed by a committee – and that it will probably only be the beginning , but I believe it is preferable for us to adopt this proposal for a directive as quickly as possible , at least so that we may have a departure point to work from , firstly in the second reading and then , no doubt , when further legislative proposals are needed .
Mr President , our group supports the Brinkhorst report , as Mr Pronk has already said .
Secondly , I am one of those who are <unk> by current neo-liberal trends in the EU .
( Applause ) Regarding junior doctors , I would refer to what Mr Provan said , because he explained quite clearly what we eventually achieved .
Mr President , the time it has taken for us seriously to discuss an illness like Alzheimer &apos;s disease is a sign of the problem we have in understanding how a change in the population pyramid means that we need to redirect our priorities in both scientific research and the way society is organized .
I am in favour of this report but I do not agree with its hypocrisy .
Mr President , I would like to thank Commissioner Reding for her response to Mr Andreasen .
I can thus fully support the agreement reached .
Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I would like to say how grateful and obliged we are to the Commission and the Council for the excellent preparation of the WTO Ministerial Conference in <unk> .
Mr President , Commissioner , we already knew that there were not really any good intentions behind the trade negotiations , but it must be acknowledged that being at the Hong Kong Conference meant sitting in on a summit characterised by hypocrisy !
Furthermore , <unk> of engines are also necessary for other alternative fuels which do benefit from tax exemption : <unk> , <unk> natural gas , electricity , etc .
Here there are situations <unk> civil war and <unk> this country - one of the world &apos;s poorest - into virtual <unk> .

I abstained on the final vote as I believe Parliament fails to recognise the achievements of Nice .
Only partial amendments to the calendar can be voted on .
Take Europe &apos;s biggest project , EMU ; a recent conference in Singapore highlighted the enormous trade , commercial and financial opportunities which will deepen between the two economic blocks once the Euro partners the dollar and the <unk> as a world reserve currency .
We cannot have a deepening without at the same time having a widening .
Similarly , one amendment attempts to extend the scope of the regulation to taxation : this is simply not acceptable .
Safety is one of those areas where we can always find middle ground to achieve what we really want .
Whereas we are denied import quotas , China ’ s state owned factories benefit from export subsidies , state aid and even free electricity , as well as the benefits of its <unk> <unk> currency .
For the last few years as a frequent <unk> with <unk> , I and my fellow passengers have <unk> lost luggage , delayed flights , tremendously <unk> planes , <unk> staff - especially in Brussels - incompatible computer systems ( even within one company ) and a level of inconvenience which , if associated with a major <unk> , would have produced consumer resistance and bankruptcy a long time ago .
Even the understanding of the outcome which needs to be achieved by means of a certain law can be totally different from country to country .
The fact that Europe &apos;s political leaders should now be addressing themselves to this issue , and considering how to overcome obstacles in this area , is therefore quite <unk> in some ways .
We must also , however , be conscious of which requirements placed on economic operators are fair , reasonable and effective and which are unworkable , ineffective or simply unreasonable .
We must find channels of communication which will enable us to teach citizens about the challenges that they themselves must <unk> with in the future .
I should like to stress the point that , in the field of transport , the Commission is proposing higher maximum rates of aid .
Now it is being reinstated .
In the committee , there was a grand unanimity – 50 members voted in favour of the proposals and none voted against .
The next item is the report ( <unk> / 1999 ) by Mr Medina Ortega , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation ( EEC ) No <unk> / 1991 on the application of the provisions of Community law to the Canary Islands ( COM ( 1999 ) <unk> - <unk> / 1999 - <unk> ( CNS ) ) I commend the rapporteur ’ s work for finding a solution to an increasingly common problem , in that it considers airlines operating within the European Union to be liable in the event of <unk> situations such as those described previously .
For example they made undertakings on what data they would not use and how they would handle the data they do use .
On that basis I announced a regulation and we started public consultation .
The Council may have to have a rethink on that unless it comes forward with a better idea which we have not yet thought of .
I am referring to documents such as the establishment of priorities by the Presidency , the Commission &apos;s communication , the action lines , the guidelines of the recent General Affairs Council and all the documents and contributions of the countries of the South and the East of the Mediterranean .
I am not proposing increased assistance for Russia , even though we spend only a fraction on cooperation with this our most important neighbour compared with what we spend on cooperation with the Mediterranean region .
However , despite being formally attached to the legislative text , its precise legal value remained unclear until Commissioner Kinnock <unk> us in his letter of 1 July to Mr <unk> , chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , in which he wrote : &apos; I believe that the European Parliament should be involved in any changes to the list of priority projects &apos; .

<unk> energy and wind power will be a very marginal energy source in the near future .
This rejection did not , however , <unk> the European Union into a crisis ; rather , it did no more than make it clear that the EU was already in one .
I would also like to sound a warning to the industry here , since it is itself always talking about self-regulation : these requirements will also have to be complied with and corresponding standards created without undue delay .
In this context , I would also like to raise another pressing question .

For that reason , the wording of Amendment No 8 is justified .
One reason I support the initiative is because there are some Members of this House who take the view that we should ultimately compel manufacturers to come and collect used <unk> from our <unk> .
Since Parliament &apos; s report seeks to establish benchmarks and curb the ambitions of the Commission , we have abstained from voting on it .
Applause Well , that is not the case .
He has certainly made the point , in the text presented to us , that the fight against fraud is not an element in partisan <unk> or in the internal politics of Member States .
We will see , Mr President , when we read the conclusions .
Another debate absent from the agenda concerns the attempts to ( <unk> ) impose the so-called ‘ European Constitution &apos; , which has already been rejected .
And this is because if there is no clear identification of a legislative body – which I believe must be as unified as possible – we are condemned to continuing to adopt this type of legislation in which there are great contradictions .
I have heard from them about the promotion of hatred , the promotion of discrimination , the promotion of evil .
In that case , I shall act on her advice , and hope that she was right .

No , that will not do .
These measures already go further than the existing EU measures .
I am therefore delighted that I can come to you first and present our proposed solution today .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my dear Mr Verheugen , we did nothing about Kosovo in the early days .
Once again , Mrs <unk> &apos; excellent report is a major contribution to that .
We have voted against it .
I am thinking , for example , of binding targets .
We will also have to have new bases for allocating aids , since <unk> them on an average amount received over the last three years excludes those small farmers who grow products that are not eligible for aid , but which from the standpoint of multifunctionality should also be entitled to it , like the others .
And one must clarify ways of making data protection cooperation more effective between the Secretariat to be created and the national authorities .
The debate is closed .
I want the amendment in the name of my group - Amendment No 33 - to stand .

Mr President , I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report .

I also call on the airlines to adopt the recommendations of paragraph 13 ( c ) as soon as possible , particularly regarding smoke <unk> , water <unk> systems and externally mounted <unk> .

In this particular case we believe that the Agreement has its own negotiating context and it would not be right , after the Agreement has been approved by the European Union and agreed by the Council , to make its final signing dependent on the resolution of an issue , however important this may be , which is only one part of the whole picture .
We have a special partnership with Russia .

I would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today , and not about the Geneva Convention .
( The sitting was closed at <unk> a. m . ) ( 2 ) The consequences are catastrophic , to both fish and man .

Today , everyone is agreed that the monitoring system must be updated and tightened up .

The fact that the exchange of tissues and cells can result in the transmission of disease has focused attention on the need for increased safety measures .
Of course , on the basis of this study - and I do not think that one study will resolve all the problems - and any proposals that may be made , we shall see how we are going to respond .
The proposal does not seek to prohibit other schemes operating at a national or regional level .
I voted against the Voggenhuber report , which attempts to exploit Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union to implement , in the area of general policy and citizens ’ rights , a new form of ‘ multilateral monitoring ’ , added to the one arising from the Maastricht Treaty for economic policy and the one that the socialists would like to strengthen in the social field .

Mrs Mouskouri &apos;s report <unk> the nail on the head as regards the Council decision on the <unk> programme , which is reminiscent of the <unk> <unk> <unk> technique in <unk> architecture : <unk> on <unk> where you could not afford real ones is just like making budget cuts on minor items , and at the same time undermining the function of those items by substantially extending the tasks for which they are earmarked and the range of potential applicants .
While it is difficult to forecast the outcome of the current round , the one thing we can be certain about is that a reduction in tariff protection will be part of any agreement .
Of course , the broader interests of the forestry industry also affect other areas of competence of the Commission : environmental policy , obviously , for which my colleague Mrs Bjerregaard is responsible , but also some aspects of research and development policy .
We needed the Pakistan authorities to tell us that the London suicide <unk> had been to Pakistan and probably on to Afghanistan , where they <unk> terrorist <unk> and training .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Middle East crisis is escalating .
In the long run this will only be possible if each country has a full seat in the College of Commissioners .
Secondly , an improvement in the skills and quality of the health professions in Europe is needed if we are to meet the excellence criteria we set ourselves .
Madam President , there is a political dimension to this , which Mr Haarder mentioned .
It is sometimes also possible to infringe copyright with legal and seemingly harmless software .
But if this agreement were going to be for three years , those concerned would be expecting <unk> million euros from the solidarity of the European Union .
After all , it is the SIS II system which creates certain technical opportunities and is thus one of the conditions ensuring that the common immigration policy becomes a shared responsibility for all Member States , not just for those most affected by illegal immigration and terrorism .
Together they will meet the concerns of our citizens , who will not have to bear the cost of the transition .
What does the Commission think about this ?
According to the findings of the Luxembourg Committee for a Just Peace in the Middle East , this war would have exposed the Palestinians to serious dangers .
<unk> has been shown towards the ten new countries which will have to undergo further waves of liberalisation and privatisation .

These are , as the Treaty specified and as the Court of Justice reminded us , additional sessions - let me specify &quot; additional &quot; - which can be scheduled only if the normal Strasbourg <unk> have been held regularly .
That will be corrected .
( 1 ) The crisis is made less profound by the fact that more members of the public than ever before are taking an interest in Europe , and there are two things that they want : they want more input into debates , and they want Europe ’ s actual policies to go in a different direction .
Therefore , before we even think of passing more powers to the European Union , we must take into account its past activities and failures .
I would add that the contacts established between those most directly concerned have already led to agreement on a considerable number of practical measures .
– Mr President , the resolution on the Convention on International Trade in <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> is an important step in preparation for the <unk> meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention .
This is why I am convinced that the Irish Government ’ s action , <unk> but effective , should be supported .
It is a good thing to reconstruct what was destroyed in our country by Communism and by <unk> <unk> , but you who have a Prime Minister , Mr Berlusconi , who has even <unk> his face , could you also reconstruct the faces of us old people , as that would give us so much pleasure ? ’ I fully agree with the Members who have underlined the importance of visa <unk> for the countries of the Western Balkans , including Albania .
However , credibility is enhanced by the option of being able to mobilise additional assets at any time without delay .
It is intended that the Member States should be supported making policies enabling all young people , once their basic education is completed , to possess sufficient key competences to be able to embark on adult life , and adults to develop these competences in line with the latest knowledge throughout their lives .
The definition alone will not enable us to provide appropriate treatment for the patients - as opposed to criminals - whom we now have to deal with .
Mr President , even though the Christian Democrats are late <unk> to the idea of a Committee of Experts which they opposed in January , we in the Socialist Group welcome the fact that they now support the establishment of the Committee of Experts and we look forward to its second report which will be published within the next couple of months .
The European Union will continue to defend wholeheartedly the rapid creation of an ad hoc committee with a negotiating mandate compatible with the Union &apos;s actions .
We need to take a look at what we have achieved over the past 10 to 12 years and the results are overwhelming – everything from enlargement to justice and home affairs , CFSP , and , of course , the single currency .
As I have already had occasion to emphasise , however , we need to fight against a very <unk> prejudice : liberalising rail transport does not mean that safety standards cannot be stepped up .
Is it necessary to point out that that text has been buried by the <unk> ‘ no ’ vote of the French and the Dutch and by the fact that the British have put it on hold ?
The European Union must uphold the rule of law .
Yes , it is true , the text is even better , proving once again the importance of Parliament ’ s work as co-legislator .
Here it states , and I quote : &apos; The level of non-compliance is rather high .
I believe that the response could be <unk> .

As an institution , the European Parliament has the interests of the citizens at heart , and should therefore have no <unk> with it .
This is now also true of the <unk> on the Albanian side .
Lastly , I have been criticised for many omissions , including the debate on the definition of the role of local authorities .
In this connection , we mention the original concept of Lomé , partnership , providing that concept with a new , powerful content , the opposite of the <unk> and unilateral conditionality imposed by the international financial institutions .
The first question concerns the means of achieving a balance between the stability policy which <unk> itself in the form of the single currency , and a policy of promoting research , innovation for small businesses and investments in TENs , which will enable the European regions to integrate .
The first level is to create a food authority or agency , founded on the principles of integrity , transparency and independence - independence , amongst other principles , is essential .
Employment must be the core of that agenda .
The report suggests that the other institutions will also gradually follow this lead .
On all these points , and on many others , the in-depth and sustained discussions which took place between the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission enabled us to reach an agreement .
I do not think this is an ideal situation , and we must do everything we can to draft a general regulation .
As the House is probably aware , there have been recent announcements by David <unk> of the <unk> <unk> Party and <unk> <unk> of Sinn <unk> .
It must rather be a real agent of equality of opportunity and of citizenship .
Nonetheless , thanks to Mrs Breyer &apos;s amendment , Parliament has succeeded in putting pressure on both the Commission and the Food Committee .
This new policy , which became necessary after the last major enlargement , covers a vast geographical area .
These two principles are <unk> linked .
First and foremost , it will help to implement our policy of sustainable development with the ethics essential to an action of such breadth .
I thank Mr Provan for his report , which is a fair representation of the almost unanimous opinion of the Fisheries Committee .
How should the EU &apos;s members in fact interpret this ?
On the third floor of our building at the moment an event is taking place to present the Olympic truce .
We should use and expand existing initiatives before introducing measures which are unpopular and which often do not produce the right effect .
<unk> for payment cards alone exceeds $ US 2 000 billion a year throughout the world .
<unk> locations such as Madrid , Bonn , Luxembourg , Lille , Vienna , Lisbon or London are under discussion .

In this regard , just like the French Government , we are opposed to moving beyond Directive 91 / <unk> .
As I have said on several occasions , this is a topic to which I attach an extraordinarily high degree of importance .
So what has happened in the meantime ?
Members will be given the opportunity to react to the Council ’ s response in due course .
It was in meetings with NGOs , particularly in private conversations , that the state of play in the various areas under negotiation was described much more clearly , and in terms at once more sober and more dramatic .
On the <unk> proposal , the Commission can accept four amendments in full , one in part and seven in principle .
I regard that as modest enough , and we have to set down clear <unk> here .
As I said , unfortunately , the Member States are happy to support research with fine words , but not with money .
It is now time to sound the alarm over these plans and to prevent <unk> Eurocrats , civil servants and ministers from creating an EU state without democracy .
All the individual cases discussed here this afternoon point to fundamental human rights violations .
Why should we question nuclear technology ?
It is important to remember that , in terms of the approach to the citizens of the European Union , it is our ability to take action on issues like this which is very important so that people recognise that they are part of a citizens &apos; Europe and that if they have problems in one country , they can make representation through the legal system properly .
This measure is urgently needed , particularly because of the Union &apos;s inability to implement a genuine common foreign and security policy , even at its own borders !
Mrs Schreyer , we are waiting <unk> for the Green Paper from the Commission on this subject .
I believe that Parliament has allowed itself to be <unk> by the big pharmaceutical companies and by the Commission , and that we have taken a massive step backwards .
Mr President , it may seem surprising that we on the left congratulate the rapporteur and welcome his report , but we are convinced by its content .
This is why we questioned your colleagues during the sitting of the parliamentary committee and that is why we ask you too what assurances and what guarantees you can give us to ensure that the entire network will be financially viable .
It was also a movement working for democratic freedoms , free elections , free media and freedom of religion .
This would perhaps add the political weight which we need , and which is lacking , in order to tip the balance in favour of more comprehensive recognition of decisions .
The debate is closed .
It is essential to ask the question of what sense there is , most of the time , in the transport of live animals .
In this connection , I note with satisfaction that among the various savings there was no change to the funding allocated for enlargement of the EU to include Bulgaria and Romania .
Having said that , there is another exception which is more controversial , which is ordinary private <unk> .
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament are voting in favour of the Anastassopoulos report .
We support growth when it is strong , and then , since there is a lack of money , we penalise growth when it is weak .
It is crucial to current , and any future , aid that we avoid duplication in the use of resources , as well as the problems which might be created by types of urgent need not covered by one or other financial aid <unk> .
It goes as far as to do away with all the derogations from Article 6 ( 2 ) that water experts regard as necessary and that are also contained in the 1980 <unk> Directive .
( Applause from the left ) The alternative wording refers to a <unk> basis .
Let me finish my contribution to today ’ s debate , however , by <unk> our minds back to July when we took over the Presidency .
From this point of view , the project for institutional innovation of which you have spoken may , I believe , be the subject of dialogue , as Mr Bourlanges just said , between the different forces within this Parliament .
The figures do not look very significant , but they represent millions of tonnes of material which must be collected , recycled and new markets found .
Just a few years ago the debate on ESDP <unk> around the location and staffing of a small planning cell in a <unk> of Brussels .
This shows where a development can lead with political support , and it is surely one that we all welcome .
Mr President , I would just like to inform the House that , in order to avoid confusion between chemical formulae and <unk> , the English version of Annex I , part I is the correct text .
I am not familiar with the 1995 proposal which was rejected by the Council or by Parliament , I am not too clear about that .
This is the philosophy one should adopt when looking at minorities - that would be far more positive .
Both are victims of the system .
Will you mention relations between Georgia and Russia when you meet him ?
This is a subject I would like to dwell on for a moment , because the House made a point of highlighting it on today &apos;s agenda .
Does it take the view that <unk> of this type encourage competition and benefit consumers ?
Matters are particularly vague regarding the , to my mind , key issue of the potential extension of majority voting within the Council , particular on two truly vital issues .
Today , Commissioner , it is not enough to simply <unk> the terrorists .
Does anyone wish to speak in favour of or against this request ?
But it will not be possible to reach this important environmental goal if , at the same time , nuclear power is abolished .
In its reporting procedures , the Commission must acknowledge the priority and the importance that we attach to these areas and ensure that these are reflected in the quality of its analysis tools .
The <unk> and <unk> that so often both go towards producing terrorism and result from it are at least as great a threat to the European Union as terrorism itself .
However , we also support the initiative relating to the summit &apos; s main objective , which has already been mentioned .
When I hear the Israelis say , we live on only a small strip of land ; a few bombs , a few long range missiles with biological and chemical weapons of the kind being developed in Iraq , and we would have had it ; then we should take these <unk> seriously .
The key idea running through this whole communication is that a concern for biodiversity must be extended into other policy areas .
At the present moment there is no decision .
However , what we will , of course , be able to incorporate is the specific addition , &apos; prevention of pollution from ships &apos; .
The appointing authority decides on the opening of the disciplinary procedure as laid down in Article 87 of the Staff Regulations .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , one of the expressed intentions of the current review of the treaties is to bring Europe closer to its peoples .
The EPLP agrees with the general approach of the rapporteur to settle at a balance of regulatory and market needs .
We think it is important for Parliament to be involved in settling such political issues and for the codecision procedure to be used to the full .
.
That right , so recently granted to Parliament <unk> , is now being <unk> away .
Only Friday afternoon remained , i. e. too little time to come to a conclusion within a reasonable period .
Do you know that , in recent years , 6 000 inspectors have gone looking for weapons ?
That is why I say that now , when I see the issue of European identity being debated so often in Europe , I have to stress that it is rooted in respect for our various national , regional and local identities .
I wish to say quite clearly here that a group of three <unk> has no authority to overturn the Rules of Procedure .
( Applause ) I would be preaching here to the converted if I were to repeat what was also rightly stressed in the debate on the Thomas report concerning the multiple role played by European forests in the environmental , health and leisure fields but also in social and economic areas .
<unk> is maintained through the interaction of a huge number of individual entities , linked together by a close network of connections and reactions .
For our part , we wish to recover our sovereignty and <unk> the <unk> of European resistance .
This affects a large number of <unk> companies , and the innovative benefit of chemical substances is crucial if they are to remain able to compete with those in the USA , China and other Asian countries .
I believe that true <unk> development would support women with safe <unk> and <unk> care , <unk> care and <unk> .
We must use our influence how and when we can .
In particular , guarantees of up to EUR 25 000 should be available for SMEs .
Quite the contrary .
I shall merely point out that we are concerned here with a common position .
This is a <unk> item , so the socialists should not be <unk> of it .
It is not therefore in a position to accept those amendments concerning the extension of the list of the products .
But yes indeed , Mr <unk> is referring to Mr Paul van <unk> .
The reason : <unk> .
As regards the second point , the new strategy lays down ambitious objectives .
In this regard , I share the criticism of the Committee on Legal Affairs .
To put it another way , the vote took place when this House was in possession of false information .
What general conclusion can be drawn from it ?
In my opinion , these elements would be perfectly adequate and we should not <unk> remits , duties or structures .
Like the rapporteur , I am concerned about the possibility of social problems such as a rural <unk> and increased unemployment , and stress the importance of <unk> farming in the accession countries .
Everything must be done , through legislation and other means , to reverse the situation , to reduce the excesses and abuses taking place , and <unk> to defend public radio and television worthy of the name .
Of the <unk> new drugs <unk> between 1975 and 1996 , only 13 of those drugs were developed to treat tropical diseases and only 4 of those 13 were the result of the pharmaceutical industry &apos;s research .
Thirdly , the families of offenders should not be <unk> into a sort of <unk> .
As a result , the Union is obviously extremely keen to remain at the forefront in this age of information .
It is that we request the Commission to launch a legislative initiative to declare , in the European Union , <unk> as an addiction producing substance ; it may make quite a difference to the whole treatment in this sector in future .
We need different solutions in Ukraine , and we need different solutions throughout central Europe .
More accidents , with all their consequences , cost far more than a great many preventive measures ever could .
Its aim is to bring together all of Europe &apos;s democratic nations within the European Union .
A more repressive asylum policy has led to an increase in the number of illegal immigrants .
We owe this partly to our colleague Mr Brok and our former colleague Mrs <unk> .
Madam President , the Commission wishes to stress the importance of the instrument which we are proposing to Parliament .
.
The proposed total budget is to be EUR 235 million within the framework of the Financial Perspective for 2007 – 2013 .
We must therefore change our policy , <unk> on law and on the promotion of law , and this is what we are attempting to do with the text of this resolution .
As you know , it will take another five to ten years before we have Community legislation on this area .
For example , the <unk> of donors clearly shows the existence of forgotten crises or of what are known as orphan countries , together with <unk> situations in which the beneficiary countries are incapable of <unk> a huge quantity of aid provided on a one-off basis .
It is about opposing any state <unk> to itself the right to annex land .
There seems to be a contradiction there ...
The Commission has taken this resolution forward .
I have also listened very carefully to the chairman , Mr Rocard , who I value greatly .
In conjunction , therefore , with highly developed social systems , it provides the possibility to carry out the necessary structural changes in the economies of our societies in such a way as to avoid conflict and safeguard social stability .
They were accused of involvement in an attack using <unk> and of <unk> national unity .
I was <unk> to hear that progress in being made in that respect , since on our last visit to <unk> we found that the cleaning up of those nuclear <unk> is proceeding at an extremely slow rate .
We cannot continue to accept the secrecy with which the WTO acts , the way in which it deals with <unk> organisations .
It is clear that the Union already has a deep and close relationship with the countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East .
These we have to sort out ourselves .
We are delighted that there was an almost unanimous consensus , however , on the new practical approach to the general discharge .
Indeed , I believe the allocation of rural funding should bear some proportionality to the budgetary contributions of Member States .
I hope the participants in the intergovernmental conference will agree and finally set out definite rules .
That said , you would have thought that Buenos Aires and Kyoto might have tackled the causes of the problem , such as by banning <unk> from <unk> gases and banning human beings and the like from breathing so that we do not <unk> CO2 .
Tomorrow , by receiving Prime Minister Netanyahu and then on Friday , President Arafat , we are continuing our <unk> action in favour of peace .
Some of you , including Mr Monti , have said that this legislation is being reviewed in any case .
What I therefore ask is that the Commission statement be made first and that then the speakers should take the floor , so that everybody might have the same right as MEPs to hear , and be able to reply to , the statement by the Commissioner .
And might it not be the case that what is advocated by Mrs <unk> and others - and obviously you , Mr Morillon , as well - might become the greatest campaign for recruiting terrorists that we have seen in recent years ?
I wish you the best of luck in your efforts .
This Parliament , which condemned Italy and its government for the criminal act of <unk> to Libya , must now act consistently , which is the reason why we are calling on the groups which voted with us for the resolution on Lampedusa to now draw up a resolution condemning the events in Ceuta and <unk> .
At the informal Council meeting at <unk> in October 1997 this question was on the agenda .
I call on Nepal to work towards elections by next year .
<unk> are aware that our democratic societies are more open and consequently more vulnerable .
Mr President , as group coordinator in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , I just wanted to point out that there are differing views on this subject in our group , something which I intended to point out in my speech today .
The most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B.
The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive , but is comprehensive for strand B.
The Commission reserves the option to , at a later date , put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions , for strand <unk> We need more effective economic policies which strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy , promote convergence , encourage productive investment , especially <unk> investment , and create jobs , if we are to <unk> fears caused by what is , unfortunately , an uncontrollable influx of immigrants , the criminality ascribed to them and persistent high unemployment , especially among the young .
As for the measures taken in other Member States , the <unk> in which cases of BSE have appeared have so far been slaughtered as far as possible .
It is very positive to note that our Parliament accepts by an overwhelming majority firstly , that any renationalisation of regional policy would be devastating even to the very existence of the European Union , of which it is a basic <unk> fabric , secondly , that the so-called statistical effect of enlargement – of any enlargement – would be addressed in such a way as to ensure continuing support for the regions for which it was considered necessary before enlargement , in order not to interrupt their progress towards development , thirdly , that the special regions from the point of view of natural disadvantages will also need to receive special treatment and finally , that the cohesion policy , which is indeed an essential tool to enable the Union to achieve the Lisbon objectives , has provided important results to date .
Madam President , I want to make two points .
While I agree with Mrs Pack that the grant for Erasmus students needs to be increased , that must not result in those Member States that top up <unk> from national funds – as Austria does , for example – reducing their contributions ; on the contrary , they should adapt to the new requirements .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Barnier .
Indeed , just labelling foods or feedingstuffs in which tests have revealed the presence of modified <unk> or protein , <unk> the Commission &apos;s line , would be <unk> the way for a sort of colonisation of the European <unk> system .
There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means , above all , men &apos; s lives .
The President-in-Office referred to what she described as the biggest challenge facing us in the run-up to the millennium : bringing unemployment down for the next generation and providing more jobs .
( The Minutes were approved thus amended ) Thank you very much , Mr <unk> .
As you know , the Commission made it clear in its document on a European strategy for Turkey that certain proposals could not be implemented without appropriate financial aid .
<unk> / 1999 by Mr <unk> , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Seventh <unk> on state aid in the European Union in manufacturing and certain other sectors &#91; COM ( 1999 ) <unk> - <unk> ­ <unk> / 1999 - 1999 / <unk> ( COS ) &#93; ; It is important from the investor &apos;s point of view , as this will not lead to enterprises being <unk> by costs at the outset and this will also ensure that emissions trading does not work like a tax .
Mr President , one could , with reference to Mr Goebbels &apos; report , say that it was worth it in the end .
This is a significant vacuum in relation to the quality of <unk> fuels .
This is not what the 72 <unk> people living in poverty and the 18 <unk> unemployed had been hoping for .
Mr Alyssandrakis has the floor on a point of order .
Our <unk> must be made known , Mr President , and it must also be effective .
Two pilot projects are planned for Spain , France and Germany - the large countries - but the Commission says nothing about the other countries .
The Johannesburg summit also reiterated the essential nature of respect for environmental and social standards and human rights .
In its great wisdom , or for fear of the potential developments , the Council introduced some changes and some articles which were not at all acceptable to us .
Thank you very much , Mrs Ahern .
It is for these reasons that Article 3 , as <unk> in the common position , stipulates that the requirements on grip and on rolling resistance shall be integrated with the noise requirements in the extended timetable of 24 and 36 months respectively , following the entry into force of this directive .
I have noted that the actual choice cannot be made on the basis of this document .
It should be possible for prices on the world market to rise to a level that enables most farmers to produce food , and it is therefore quite obvious that all forms of aid that distort trade must be done away with .
Mr President , I voted for this report .
That would be a great help in setting our minds at rest .
That is why it was the concern both of the Austrian Presidency and of the Council to initiate the dialogue between experts in international law , to present the debate in objective terms and to strive for common positions corresponding to our system of values .
Let us ensure that our international agreements , which come down to our aid and our cooperation having first to be for the benefit of the poorest , actually make this possible and that the government is obliged to lend its assistance in this .
We have here Commissioner Liikanen who knows the subject very well , and perhaps he could give us a more specific response , as I believe that this considerably affects the core of additionality .
Some of the Members have referred to the particular problems that Turkey has with the Kurdish language and the problems in Turkey .
I am afraid that in order to do that we first need an IGC so you will have to wait for some time .
It is vital to have tough protection for intellectual property so that small and medium-sized firms with short <unk> <unk> can genuinely participate , and I am glad the Commission was equally negative about Amendment No 6 , because I cannot see it as positive .
After extensive consultation with my officials and with officials and fishing representatives in Member States , I can agree to some modification in the size and number of closed areas for fishing for <unk> .
It is essential that the Commission should take due account of these comments and , in the future , draft proposals for directives whose primary interest will be not the <unk> or promoters but the consumers .
It does , however , constitute the first stage of a wider discussion launched by Commission President Prodi himself , concerning what is called the governance of the Union .
These and other abuses were emphatically condemned in the resolution .
This year - 1997 - has been an important year for the European Union because of the great number of questions addressed , and because of the important political events which have taken place : the Intergovernmental Conference ; the employment summit ; technical decisions about the implementation of economic and monetary union ; and the extremely important decisions about enlargement made at the European Council in Luxembourg last weekend .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking today on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to submit my opinion on the issue of comitology .
This activity has still not been regulated and , consequently , is not covered by the rules governing fishing .
Mr President , in my opinion , this proposal has been submitted under rather strange procedural circumstances .
Union leaders have been stripped of their powers and taken to court for having criticised the management of the trade union group in a simple internal petition .
The Interinstitutional Agreement that resulted from the Summit was good news for the powers of this Parliament .
Our committee has appreciated this initiative .
I urge you not to turn a blind eye to abortion tourism , the journeys which some women are compelled to undertake because contraception has indeed failed them .
That is to say , the Commission is using Europeans &apos; money to manipulate Europeans .
Turning to the basis of the petitions recorded and dealt with , we see that a large number of complaints <unk> serious breaches of Community environmental legislation have been <unk> this year .
Just a brief clarification following what Mrs <unk> said .
From the standpoint of cohesion , it is very important to adopt transparent criteria that allow all disadvantaged regions to receive financial aid .
She mentioned football hooligans several times .
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for your very precise and competent answer .
I can only agree with the Member who has put the question to me , that enough is enough .
In particular , the criterion of contributing to a multinational approach should be deleted entirely to avoid the suspicion that we are doing this for our own sake .
A ‘ <unk> ’ to bring Europe to the countryside .
I fully agree with you that here there are many problems facing Europe that could be solved .
<unk> no less than four and a half million out of six million inhabitants voted .
They are my concerns because I am interested in upholding the law .
.
On the other hand , however , we were confronted with an extremely worrying precedent , namely that under the influence of the extreme Left in this House , and of ideological prejudices held by Members of this House , Mr Buttiglione ’ s , nomination was withdrawn .
We have always adopted the position that the Commissioners should also be able to exercise this responsibility .
It is not possible to separate the two problems .
Finally , I would stress that the protection of personal data in Internet communications falls within the ad hoc legal framework governing the processing of personal data established by Directives 95 / 46 / EC and 97 / 66 / EC , which entered into force on 25 October 1998 .
– Mr President , I thought that you had understood the point of order I presented previously to call for the withdrawal of Amendments 2 to this favourable opinion and to the favourable opinion by Mr Moscovici .
We Conservatives support the broad aims of this report but feel greater emphasis should be placed on further studies into the means of achieving them and the need for research into the efficacy of the various therapies before calling for European level legislation .
Clearly , Turkey does not respect our standards in the area of human rights and nothing final can be decided without progress in this extremely sensitive area .
Today , many people are already wondering why euro notes and coins had not been introduced much earlier , something we Members had always demanded .
Mr President , honourable Members , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great honour and a great pleasure for me to address you here in this Chamber .
Your time of glory in the Presidency may have come to an end in the European Union , but your responsibility has not .
So far , there are a great many small and medium-sized businesses , especially those working for the local market , who can only see the <unk> .
Mr President , I was very disappointed to have to vote against the report at the end .
There is a point , however , to which the Napolitano report claims , according to the explanatory statement , to have brought <unk> extremely important innovation &apos; : that is , the proposal of some sort of <unk> constituent power &apos; .
However , the wording of all amendments - and I am also making this point in response to comments made by Mrs Villiers - would then have to be adapted in order to guarantee the compatibility and consistency of these amendments with Article 20 .
But above all , what measures do you intend to adopt to facilitate a political agreement on the issue , an agreement which is of prime importance for the Commission , Council and Parliament to be able to take a final decision on this matter ?
I believe , therefore , with the European Parliament , that the veto should go , and should go quickly .
A real change in our modes of production and consumption is needed : inaction on this will come at a high price and have serious consequences , especially for the growing number of poor people in our society .
European diplomacy must become a genuine instrument of cooperation and collective security .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the request by a number of members of the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats for a secret vote on the Eurlings report speaks volumes about the <unk> manner in which the advocates of Turkey ’ s accession to the EU – including the governments of the Member States in London , Berlin , Rome , but also the Belgian Government in Brussels – <unk> implement Washington ’ s agenda and bring pressure to bear on members of parliament and politicians , against the will of the large majority of the people , to push through a decision which will have dramatic historic and social implications for Europe .
I do not know why this proposal has been made all of a sudden .
As regards principles and objectives , the Commission welcomes Parliament &apos;s approval and the fact that it responds to the guidelines from the reports by Mr Rocard and Mr Martens .
They are the same forces , with the same level of preparation and readiness that most of our nations have - of course I belong to one of the nations that is not a member of the Alliance .
In Sweden , politicians who want to influence opinion against European cooperation have exploited this proposal for a directive to cast suspicion on the EU as a threat to traditional hunting .
Please do not <unk> me next time !
I am expecting the West to put at least as much trust in them as in Milosevic , if not more , since they have joined in an alliance with Mrs <unk> , leader of the Civil Alliance , who has campaigned from the outset against war in the region .
I would be grateful if this could be clarified afterwards , because we voted on the assumption that this was not a TDI amendment , but an amendment tabled by the rapporteur .
- ( FR ) I am delighted by the decision just taken by our Assembly to create , as I myself had requested , a temporary commission of the European Parliament devoted to safety at sea .
Nor do I object to these products remaining freely <unk> .
We want to set up basic rules that guarantee a level playing field without <unk> with the actual content of the media .
I would ask us to send an observer force because there could be more trouble in those local elections than in the other elections .
I would praise the <unk> with which you have contributed to the drafting of those guidelines .
The Commission welcomes Parliament ’ s interest in its report on the Programme for Action .
Public involvement in the creation of the draft European constitution is another step in this direction .
I also hope , as the rapporteur just mentioned , that ways will be found to deal effectively with the <unk> problem of application and implementation .
I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee &apos; s debate .
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis , that is , in the operational Directorates-General , amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money , so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less <unk> and time-consuming .
I also congratulate the coalition government in place since last September .
Basically , the request that we are going to examine to change the agenda is slightly paradoxical , because the entire strategy carried out by the rapporteurs and the Commission was aimed at having a joint debate on those two texts : the policy of the Central Bank and the information and communication strategy regarding the euro .
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed .
Rural regions that remain <unk> become <unk> naturally , which is also the case with areas of <unk> that have been cut down or burnt .
The heightened awareness of the governments of the 25 Member States and their immediate response to the humanitarian appeals of suffering peoples has assumed unforeseen proportions at the present time .
Amendments Nos 6 and 7 are taken on board in spirit by the inclusion of Amendment No 1 , and Amendment No 14 , I can fully support .
In order to take account of recent political developments in Lebanon , the Commission has recommended that the timetable for the next stage of our work and consultation with the Lebanese authorities on the action plan should be linked to developments in that country ’ s situation .
Lastly , we will need to take immediate account of the single most important matter , reform of the Structural Funds and Agenda 2000 , and with this report we are calling on the Commission to be more coherent in its policies on cities .
Is the Commission considering the possibility of finding a standard regulation in Europe which includes the Swiss authorities ?
What do you understand to mean by public order ?
These are areas that are especially close to my heart and that I have been pursuing as human rights coordinator for the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
We must create an environment which <unk> more and better jobs for our people .
And although I have to admit that it has not been the constant point of discussion on every street corner , it contains much that is of relevance to the citizens of the EU .
We had a second pillar , then we had a third pillar , and now we are in the process of constructing a fourth pillar on defence , while a de facto fifth pillar also exists on economic and monetary union .
This in fact is a very <unk> expression , because there is no country and no compulsory insurance scheme in which contributions are paid on the basis of personal rather than professional income .
I do not wish to go into issues which you have already supported and approved during 2004 , such as the networks , the implementation of the single sky or the measures to be adopted on GALILEO before the end of the year relating to the decision on the group chosen for constructing and managing GALILEO .
, in writing .
I remember very well the time that you sent Mr <unk> to see us .
We made it clear that those responsible for the murders and <unk> in <unk> must be called to account and the <unk> farmers &apos; families must be given their land back .
Still on the subject of the topical and urgent debate , I have received another request on Venezuela .
In view of this , Amendment No 37 , which provides for external certification and for <unk> declarations to be issued not just by companies , but also by external and impartial agencies , is particularly important for consumer protection , because it would , of course , considerably increase consumers &apos; confidence in such declarations .
It is linked to the combating of racism and xenophobia , to asylum policy , to the integration of immigrants , to the possibility of their obtaining legal employment in host countries and , above all , to trafficking in human beings .
This is what I have tried to contribute to with my report .
We are still far from having attained this ambitious objective .
It is unacceptable that this movement is allowed to wage such acts of aggression from Lebanese soil .
The discussion has also shown – and this shows that we were right – that this important issue should not be dealt with as a small contribution to this programme – as a peripheral phenomenon , as it were – but calls for a programme in its own right .
They are waiting for a <unk> signal from the political side &apos; of Europe .
As the Union budget quite rightly obliges us to provide for agriculture to the tune of 50 % , this step would prevent Europe from remaining just a guardian of animal capital rather than the promoter of human capital .
I am also saying this on behalf of the Council .
In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements , measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be <unk> .
As a result , the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected .
It is about time too .
Do you not think so , Commissioner Flynn ?
1994 was , in fact , the first year of implementation of the Regulation adopted by the Council in the previous year .
The report by Mrs <unk> , whom I have to congratulate , constitutes a correct basis for you to submit your proposals by the autumn at the latest .
All nuclear undertakings should have sufficient funds for decommissioning .
In some cases the involvement of the Community authorities has prompted the national authorities to apply Community law more correctly .
The Commission &apos;s strategy towards the crisis has been to act decisively and quickly .
Finally , Mr President , the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission .
It is not a lack of courage if we do not always have the same human rights clause or if we do not apply sanctions .
The suspicion arises , then , that the negative results issued by the company may be connected to decisions designed solely to make <unk> transfers at prices favourable to its associated companies .
These reports prompted discussion amongst European Union Foreign Ministers at the General Affairs Council meeting on 21 November .
At almost every part-session , however , we have to remark upon the fact that , in these areas and in many others , things in Russia are not working .
If you see the agendas , you will realise that they are increasingly full and this raises the question of whether it is possible for the General Affairs Council , with its current structure and form , to devote sufficient time to horizontal issues which are ultimately issues dealt with by the European Council .
We do not therefore believe that the proposal in the report indicates the right road to go down .
When a government or a regional or municipal authority has to repay debts , it will have to do so in full view of its citizens .
Next month , at Stockholm , on the basis of the Commission &apos;s reports , the European Council will review progress to date - the areas where we have forged ahead , but also the areas where we are lagging behind .
We will try to do that , Mrs Díez de <unk> <unk> .
It affected Ireland , the Netherlands , France and , in particular , Great Britain .
In Amendment No 99 , it is .
Yes , we should encourage more extensive livestock <unk> by adjusting the way <unk> are paid .
Sadly , we are all familiar with the <unk> of abandoned car <unk> on our <unk> .
If we want there to be a European law on associations , it is because we want to relax many of the rules and regulations in this area , thereby enabling non-governmental organisations , in particular , to operate more easily across Europe .
The rapporteur has just made a proposal .
Thousands of people in the Czech Republic , Germany , Hungary and Austria are fighting <unk> against the floods which threaten their homes , <unk> and farms .
Unfortunately , the experience of NAFTA shows us that this target was not achieved automatically , because there is evidence that free trade has had an adverse effect on the lives of many people , exacerbated environmental damage , and marginalised wide sections of the Mexican population - all the more so as Mexican human rights NGOs have also reported a deterioration in the human rights situation since the interim agreement came into force in 1998 .
This report is right to argue that any EU taxpayers &apos; money which goes in aid to Asian countries should be linked to the recipients agreeing to respect the environment when spending that aid .
We also , though , did more important things than that , in that we made it quite plain that the whole time spent either driving or <unk> must be capable of being monitored .
In relation to the question raised by Mrs <unk> , I would like to say that I have read very carefully the recommendations put to the Commission and I can already tell her that some of these are about to implemented .
There is one thing that I did not fully understand with regard to coordination amongst the African countries .
.
It is of course the case that the funds currently at the Commission ’ s disposal mean that it can already respond to certain unexpected changes .
The next item is the vote .
This is not only because we do not have the funds , it is also because it is a matter of commercial agreements .
Mr President , on a point of order .
On the third issue , the question of blood safety and <unk> in the European Community , the Commission welcomes the report of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection and I am especially glad that our own concern about the quality and the safety and the supply of blood and blood products available in the Community is shared by Parliament .
<unk> / 2000 by Mrs <unk> and others , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on Iraq ; Mr President , the Martens report touches on an essential subject which , from the very beginning , has been one of the <unk> <unk> of the European Community , that is , the will to establish a partnership , a specific form of cooperation based on official aid to significant development , with a privileged geographic sphere of cooperation .
I should like to say to her , therefore , that the Commission , as I reported earlier , discussed the matter in its meeting of 1 July .
Madam President , the European Union was built upon the idea <unk> again &apos; , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia , concentration camps , anti-Semitism , heightened nationalism or war .
Mr Watson noted that Turkey sufficiently meets the criteria , and that is also , in agreement with the Commission ’ s conclusion , the presidency ’ s position following the entry into force of the six laws .
Mr President , we see more and more every day how a common European immigration policy has become essential .
But I am certain that Mr Macartney will continue to follow this issue to see whether that evolution takes place .
The <unk> dioxin crisis highlighted the shortcomings in Community legislation and animal nutrition .
It therefore becomes essential to strengthen the dialogue that SMEs or associations of SMEs have with our universities and with the many European centres of excellence .
I must also refer to an underlying problem in this area : both in the original Commission proposal and in the proposals that have been discussed in the Council , we have noted the same thing : a lowering of own resources from 1.27 % to <unk> % in the case of the Commission proposal - entirely to the detriment of the structural funds and actions .
We have transparent mechanisms , however , for preventing these conflicts of interest from having any real effect .
The Commission will address Parliament &apos;s concerns by seriously looking at potentially problematic products which could pose unacceptable risks to health and the environment .
Together , the Members have refused any compromise solution , which is a victory for philosophy over political logic , and I am delighted about that .
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the general budget for 1999 .
Now that that attempt has failed , the Commission is instead tabling a proposal for a so-called temporary defensive mechanism for the shipbuilding industry , involving aid of between 6 and 14 per cent .
The debate is closed .
But I also welcome in particular the voluntary undertaking of the umbrella organisation of car manufacturers to meet the guidelines for CO2 reduction in a phased plan over the next few years .
This work supports the EU &apos; s efforts .
Without the financial perspective , how can the European Union make medium-term commitments to global funds for HIV / AIDS ?
There must be a positive response .
They want to <unk> Parliament .
( FR ) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union &apos; s declared ambition to <unk> attack unemployment , the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration .
It is simply designed to harmonise existing practice governing the granting of patents in Europe , and in this context , more stringent criteria are to be adopted , particularly for the granting of patents .
The Socialists asked for a split vote , which retained the training reference but removed my helpful amendment .
Some of these questions were tabled in December , but we waited <unk> for three months to put the questions to her .
This covers Amendments Nos 5 and 23 , the first part of Amendment No 24 and Amendments Nos 27 and 28 .
However , the external effects and specific infrastructural costs are not yet included in the price for the consumer .
Like Europe , Mexico was and is a meeting point where a variety of cultures converge .
As Mr <unk> <unk> has already said , agreement on the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument at first reading is now within reach .
A certain number of rules should therefore be adopted .
It is likely that in the United Kingdom this year we will produce a record number of cars .
This should be the line taken by Parliament in the run-up to the June summit , and we should send out a clear message that our policy is underpinned by credible partners who share our values .
The other countries are reluctant to take the initiative , so we must therefore establish political dialogue to overcome this reluctance on the part of many third countries to look at social standards and trade on the same level .
.
We must of course endeavour to help India in every possible way to take the right road , not because we want to control the country , but because we do not want it to make the same mistakes as many countries in Europe have done .
Of course , it is not just the company that has a responsibility .
It is not just a case of legislating for the Staff Regulations of the <unk> of the Community ; it is also a matter of constructing a working model for economic and social rights and for promoting systems which constitute an expression of equality of treatment , and the end of all legal forms of discrimination based on sexuality .
And if not , why not ?
The equality aspects have already been talked about , and it is important that we highlight them .
The present proposal , which is based on criteria endorsed by the Council , contains a new list of <unk> benefits which are subject to specific coordination .
You are raising a new issue , which nobody has been able to debate , at a time when , according to the Rules , it is not possible to do so .
The proposal that contributions to staff pensions be entered on the receipts side of the Commission budget has also fallen by the <unk> .
<unk> penalty in the world <unk> stability produces low inflation and interest rates and is thus the prerequisite for growth , employment and an economic policy leading to prosperity .
British business is already at the forefront in realising the potential of e-commerce in Europe .
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the Commissioner for the kind words he has addressed to me concerning the report .
If I thought they were going to do the same thing next year , i. e. submit an <unk> at the end of July , I would not hesitate to call a special meeting of the Budgets Committee within the <unk> timetable to make sure that we blocked it so that we could discuss it in full .
Such anomalies generate a sense of <unk> amongst Europe &apos;s citizens , not least my own constituents .
That the Commission points out to us for the first time actually to have done something in the area of health , even though it is not within its competence .
These amendments clarified a range of points , not least that competitiveness is an essential factor in fostering growth in Europe , although this is only one of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy , equally as important as cohesion and the environment .
He has been at the centre of moves towards the worldwide coordination of competition policy and enforcement .
In this century , we have already seen terrible acts of the utmost cruelty .
Our democracies cannot , and must not , aim to make everything in a person ’ s life visible ; whatever needs to be done in the fight against terrorism , the principles of the rule of law must be upheld , and so I very much hope that we , in Europe , will at last line up together to fight terrorism and organised crime .
The common position enables us to steer a middle course between vigilance with regard to human rights and support for the process of economic and social improvement .
Unfortunately , there is little reason to be <unk> .
Regarding the development of agreed test methods , this will require a <unk> year horizon .
Access to affordable medicines is an important element in our Programme for Action .
There is no automatic behaviour here ; instead we want to know in the most exact terms - for that is the crucial thing - whether , as for example Mr Mastorakis put it , people in rural areas on islands are to continue to get a good postal service .
This is why , for the time being , the Commission is not going to place a blanket ban on these flights .
We cannot introduce the concept of Natura 2000 without looking at the great families of biodiversity , because each of them requires a different financial instrument .
I share your hope that the Council will find a solution to the issue of the legal basis so that the EUR 3 400 000 can be used before the end of the year .
You know the will of this Chamber .
In this respect we need to step up our efforts to introduce recycling - both mechanical recycling and <unk> for reuse - for all PVC products .
Amendments Nos 7 and 13 are acceptable in principal , but they require some changes .
I would make a plea to the Commissioner tonight on the question of new <unk> .
I am delighted to say that announcements have been made in Britain this week by the new Labour government that in future the rather <unk> but unsatisfactory arrangements whereby <unk> engage their own vets to do checks will be replaced by vets appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture in Britain .
We have a real problem with the new technologies , which is that for the first time in human history maybe children know more than parents and <unk> .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , things are <unk> up again , and so they should !
Durban reminded us that the modern world has proved itself incapable of eradicating racism and xenophobia from its societies and these , even in Europe , continue to create victims and <unk> violent conflicts .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner <unk> and representatives of the Council , I would like to start by thanking Mr Böge and the other speakers for their unambiguous statements earlier on in the debate , particularly in view of the serious <unk> that has gone on between our three institutions over the past nine months .
There were two opinions .
Unfortunately they are only the <unk> on the cake .
People on low incomes are affected more often by disease than people on high incomes , and there is a difference between ill health in men and ill health in women .
In principle , I think that such a patent extension should be as short as possible , for in the final analysis , it is the user , or the citizen , who <unk> up the <unk> .
That is why we have produced a very critical report on these guidelines .
Our <unk> , our challenge is to find the synthesis from this democratic <unk> and <unk> , the common will to move forward .
If the rules on advertising were changed , manufacturers would grasp the opportunity to promote their products in every possible way , because they believe that advertising works .
Although the proposal &apos; s aim is commendable , it does have a number of shortcomings concerning three issues : the market situation , checks , and the marketing of <unk> oil .
Today , I am glad that I took only lots of protein , and never <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
But the broad economic policy guidelines are also a vital instrument in our progress towards economic and monetary union , and must be applied to the letter .
When asked about the most important guiding principles , Mr Trichet said , and I quote : &apos; The highest level of credibility in the pursuit of the objective of price stability , independence , enshrined in the Treaty , vis-à-vis any power or type of influence whatsoever ; lastly , realism and pragmatism in the assessment of a financial and economic environment changing rapidly , due to new technologies and changes in the behaviour of economic agents &apos; .
As far as I am concerned , every farmer can have as many cows as he chooses , as long as he does not exceed the 50 <unk> limit .
Secondly , in relation to what Mr Schulz was saying : first of all , can I thank you very much for those words about 7 July and the terrorist attacks in the UK .
That means a <unk> on top of the sales price for the product or service supplied .
The Court of Auditors too is in need of urgent reform as the result of enlargement .
We asked for this debate and tabled this resolution because each of us knows that at least two countries still have reservations , countries which were behind the setting-up of the ad hoc tribunal and which have , one of them at least , actually advocated the idea of the permanent court .
The Court of Auditors and the Commission have jointly suggested in the past that about ECU <unk> were lost by the transit system in a five-year period .
<unk> 18 % of imports and 21 % of EU exports are affected by carriers ’ ability to fix prices jointly under the <unk> conference block exemption .
That was the whole point of the committee that we created last year .
The previously promised and announced withdrawal from Gaza must also begin .
This omission must be dealt with as a matter of urgency by setting up a Committee on Information Technology and European Freedom .
To ensure that there is complete clarity on the subject something that did not come through in all the speeches I repeat : taking , if you like , Mr <unk> de <unk> &apos;s suggestion that there should be a transitional approach , I would simply say that we have done rather better than adopt a transitional approach .
Many are in fact asking themselves , Commissioner , why Europeans are always so quick to introduce taxes and new rules ?
.
Madam President , I will be brief , since my colleague Mr Novo has already clearly identified the problem .
<unk> language schools are being closed down , and education in the <unk> language is only allowed in the primary levels of elementary education .
We object on principle to the Pack report ’ s choosing a small number of schools to receive a large proportion of the total education grant from the EU .
I call on both the European Convention and those government leaders who will shortly be attending the IGC to persevere and to opt for an effective and democratic , that is communal , Europe .
The simple fact that something is intended for human consumption but is left over because nobody wants or is able to eat it , is a very long way from making it special category waste , with all the ensuing consequences for its treatment and disposal .
It is of fundamental importance that today , as we begin the second reading , we demonstrate the same attitude .
The main priority is to address the most serious of these handicaps , namely the <unk> of the outermost regions , which will be done by promoting the use of new information and communications technology , by facilitating transport links to the European mainland and by fostering the integration of the outermost regions in the surrounding areas to which they have always had their backs turned .
It is regrettable that the net <unk> mainly focus on the revenue side of the budget .
At the same time , they strengthen the strategic content of the cohesion policy and create the framework for synergy between it and the Lisbon Strategy .
The Schengen Convention is a bureaucratic <unk> , a <unk> <unk> of monitoring and control of both the countries &apos; own citizens and foreign subjects .
In the Commission &apos;s view , Amendments Nos 21 and 24 breach the basic <unk> laundering rule that the customer about whom a report is made should not be warned .
Allow me to make clear in a few points the work that we can and must get under way if we are to change the own resource system in such a way that it will also be possible for there to be progress towards reform .
Those who block , delay and put on the brakes need to be named and <unk> , instead of always reducing everything to the lowest common denominator and thus turning their backs on Europe &apos;s real needs .
His failure to do so should be met with only one response and that is the military option .
Then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the Commission as well .
We are responsible for the rule of law applying to everyone in Kosovo on a uniform basis .
<unk> is absolutely essential if we want to make our transport systems more effective and efficient .
Mr President , the report on the free movement of persons from the High Level Panel chaired by <unk> Veil is well received by Mrs Schaffner .
It would be completely absurd , especially at the <unk> of a new millennium , in an era in which man <unk> on the <unk> , if we do not manage to bring about a change in this industry or to provide accurate information regarding the genuine harm caused by smoking .
It does not seek to alter the priorities of the Lisbon strategy , but to bolster and speed up its implementation .
Report ( <unk> / 2001 ) by Mr Colom i Naval on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adjustment of the financial perspective to take account of implementation ( presented by the Commission to Parliament and the Council in accordance with paragraphs <unk> of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 ) ( COM ( 2001 ) 149 - <unk> / 2001 - 2001 / <unk> ( <unk> ) ) .
The enthusiasm that the European Parliament shows for increased power of codecision in the EU is not something that has a strong foundation amongst the electorate .
Today we still do not know whether it will and until we do I would advise this House to take a rather sceptical view of the European Commission &apos; s reform process .
I feel we would do well to ask ourselves whether these labels actually correspond to the facts in reality , whether the European social model genuinely does protect the weaker sections of society and the marginalised .
The electricity directive , for example , only deals with the problem of firms in terms of large companies , totally ignoring small and medium-sized ones .
All of us , or so I hope , at least , share this objective which aims to facilitate freedom of movement for these nationals .
<unk> you at the referendums on the EU Constitution .
This applies to paragraphs 18 and 29 .
Since the budget that has been presented – as a reflection of current European policies , with which I do not agree – is a budget that perfectly illustrates the reasons for the crisis in which we find ourselves today in Europe , I therefore , quite naturally , voted against it .
As regards the economic support given to the four poorest countries , it was decided that it would be best to maintain per capita expenditure at 1999 levels .
In the United Kingdom , we have a <unk> ethical financial services sector , offering savings and pensions which invest from a green perspective .
The English Foreign Secretary , Robin <unk> , has just turned down a very interesting arms deal with Indonesia .
Even if it is true that the vast majority of Europe ’ s citizens feel close to the essence of the spirit of the EU , it is nonetheless also true that that there is a sense of <unk> when it comes to its day-to-day running , and with regard to the content of some of its texts .
Commissioner Patten , thank you and congratulations on your speech .
We should therefore continue to uphold the equal technical criteria for all paints and not give an unfair advantage to <unk> paints .
We support your emphasis on the need for implementation of effective practical measures and better international collaboration , but I have a <unk> word : I feel sure there are some useful contributions that the EU can make in the fight against terrorism , but it has a nasty habit of merely seeking to extend its own powers on the back of a crisis and not necessarily doing anything of real practical value .
Then we also take account of the financial aspects .
We are calling <unk> , and if we are not allowed to go to the <unk> , then we may go to the courts .
Although it seems likely that a time will come when cuts in income support for arable farmers have to be placed on the agenda , I wish to stress that a radical <unk> of the system is likely to be fatal , especially to farmers in the northern Member States .
I would like to insist that , without a new framework strategy , it will be much more difficult for us to move forward .
In the past , the Commission has communicated on a number of occasions that the European Union does not accept Israel &apos;s illegal occupation policy .
Transparency must lie at the heart of creating a common stance within the EU on immigration and migration .
This is a responsibility for the Fifteen and for the European Union .
This matter could be dealt with under this heading .
Mr President , among the four <unk> topics , I consider the role of the national parliaments particularly important because it can prepare a way into the hearts of Europe &apos;s citizens .
This enables us to observe the timetable we set ourselves in committee , and observe the tighter deadlines we have this year , which could allow us to begin the budgetary conciliation procedure with the Council on 17 June , as planned .
He could actually be called Mr <unk> Responsibility , as this was the second historical directive , the second historical achievement , in which the producer &apos; s responsibility will be significantly incorporated in the European Union &apos; s environment and product legislation .
At the end of September it is hoped that talks in Australia will breathe new life into the Doha round .
We must apply the same standards that we apply to developing countries ; after all , we have been supporting the countries of Africa on the road to democracy for decades now , and the situation there still leaves much to be desired .
Amendments Nos 6 , 10 , 49 and 54 refer to the new German Länder .
It is absolutely imperative for certain measures to be put in place for this group of people , these specific victims .
Like him , I will <unk> the small talk and get straight down to business .
<unk> landmines have been designed to <unk> rather than kill their victims .
What exactly are we talking about here ?
The Commission should encourage and promote an exchange of experiences between Member States where local employment initiatives of interest have already been implemented and also will have to play in full the role of dynamic force in encouraging any credible and effective solutions that might help to tackle the social scourge of unemployment .
I have to say that a study we carried out today of the votes that will take place showed that the modifications introduced by Richard Corbett , <unk> Palacio and Vice-President Gutiérrez Díaz are important and change a good many things .
Madam President , Mr Tomlinson , Mr <unk> and the other members of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry have produced a detailed report on the transit system outlining its weaknesses .
These conclusions sent an urgent , clear and relevant message to the <unk> authorities .
A recent example is emissions trading : we must be able to fix payments and tariffs for products from third countries that do not participate in the scheme to compensate for the additional burden for companies that do .
The statement , signed by <unk> Members , demanded that , in future , the President of the Commission be elected by this House and no longer by the Council .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this matter allows the Commission to clearly state its stance on the reform of the Structural Funds and , more exactly , on the way in which it will take into account the specific characteristics of mountain regions .

Five : drawing a distinction between <unk> and cultural autonomy can be a key to progress in resolving this problem .
It shows great willingness to take risks through its commitment to projects which other banks deem too <unk> , but it does not systematically seek the security of state guarantees .
I hope that will happen in April .
<unk> is an extremely <unk> medicinal remedy ; it is also a food in wide circulation .
Our group is profoundly attached to the preservation of public health , but we are worried about the consequences of such a <unk> political position .
As honourable Members might be aware , a strong EU declaration has been issued on this subject and I can assure you that EU concerns have been brought to the personal attention of the Prime Minister by the local representative of the European Union Presidency .
For all ?
It is to be hoped that the military , although they support a secular Turkey , will now once again withdraw from politics .
The new priorities emerging from the accession opinions will take shape for each candidate country in the accession partnership .
It indicated that despite the fact that there would be more complexity , the economic analysis demonstrated that the competitive effects were <unk> small and accepted the view of the rapporteur that there were consumer benefits to offset it .
Europe is facing up to its responsibility in development policy and therefore the funds here must not be cut under any circumstances .
<unk> social responsibility is good for companies .
It <unk> on a set of policies whose repercussions will be felt by the pension systems .
My advice to the Commission would therefore be to work closely with Parliament , as this will be worthwhile in future too !
Therefore , in my opinion , a practice ought to be introduced whereby loan decisions contain a political risk assessment , otherwise , when a default occurs , the temptation may be to blame purely political factors .
The European Union ’ s capacity for creation demonstrates that those who were the <unk> candidates are now the most <unk> and , <unk> , those who demanded virtue are the ones who have <unk> most .
He spoke out openly in favour of an end to the present Palestine <unk> .
I trust there will be an opportunity for me to discuss these specific points with the House .
We in Europe have a moral and political obligation today .
I believe we must now decide as a matter of urgency to put procedures in place to ensure that industries cannot move simply to take advantage of less stringent controls and , if they do move , that they do not adopt <unk> practices to stop <unk> else taking their place .
In my country , Spain , those victims of terrorism may be decent members of the national or regional armed forces or security forces , representatives of democratic institutions , or citizens indiscriminately murdered en <unk> in public places .
The wind <unk> one cannot fail to notice when travelling through the beautiful countryside in the Black Forest area are a similar case .
However , these replies were all given last June , at the time of the vote on Mr Martens &apos; report .
Turkey in no way meets the preconditions for the opening of accession negotiations .
Thank you , Mr President .
I am sure you will succeed again .
When I spoke in similar terms within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs three or four years ago , I think my fellow Members were shocked .
I would therefore request that the lists of roll-call votes be corrected so that they correspond to the events which we all witnessed here .
Mr President , I would like to endorse what Mr <unk> has said , and , if we agree to this demand , to ask my colleagues to vote ‘ yes ’ rather than ‘ no ’ to Amendments 16 and 20 , which have to do with the content rather than the name .
It could also include early or conditional releases and integration of prisoners .
It is understandable that small and medium-sized companies naturally operate in the surroundings most familiar to them .
However , it must be said that there have been a number of incidents .
There must be no more of this .
With regard to Madeira and the Azores , <unk> to the incentive policies , it has been possible not only to consolidate but in some cases to increase the industrial fabric <unk> , enabling surplus local production , mainly tuna , <unk> and black <unk> , to be <unk> , giving prospects of sustainable development to the processing companies .
I was commenting on the Rules of Procedure and the <unk> made in the question .
The Commission should , from the beginning , have taken account of the risk of third countries &apos; introducing trade restrictions .
For example , the Court criticized certain reporting obligations which the Commission imposes on farm organizations using Community funds .
In many cases these complaints could be dealt with effectively by an Ombudsman or a similar body at national level .
They envisage a strategic European presence in Asia , yet we are certainly not in a position to provide that in the foreseeable future .
I represent Scotland , on the north-west frontier of our European continent .
The Union should respect these special links .
?
<unk> / 2003 by Mr van den Bos , on behalf of the ELDR Group , on the human rights situation in Zimbabwe ; However , I must say that today &apos;s debate has shown , first of all , just how important the problem is and how good the report is and , secondly , it has shown that in fact every one of us should be concerned with this problem , regardless of where our expertise lies .
Mr President , I voted in favour of this report .
This will <unk> on us all .
We believe that an important step in this regard is the recent conclusion of a political dialogue and cooperation agreement last December with the Andean Community and therefore also with Colombia .
Mr President , we know that yours is a state that suffers extremely high emigration , poverty , extraordinary security challenges including assassinations and kidnappings , and the extraordinary challenges of organised crime and <unk> .
In my opinion , the European Union is currently at a crossroads .
Now , as he said , in excess of 85 000 <unk> of <unk> is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually .
There are no international conflicts , there are internal conflicts , but they are on a very small scale compared to those during the <unk> , and I have the impression that this is the time for us to effectively help the good people of Latin America to move forward .
Member States must also introduce minimum values for safe distances from electronic equipment and minimum distances in general which must be complied with in the vicinity of people &apos;s homes and places of work .
But even then , you would need to have a very good idea of what would and would not be possible on a European level .
<unk> people are becoming angry at the lack of attention that they get .
We do drink port wine , and we do like German <unk> , and we even use Finnish <unk> , but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat .
I regret that the Commission does not use this regional reality as a basic principle , because I am convinced that both a regional and a European approach are necessary .
In my own country , Sweden , the debate is fully under way prior to the autumn referendum on introducing the euro .
It is also clear that at some point we will need a framework for the cross-border liability of service providers .
Mr Schwaiger has referred to the package that has been put together to cover the financial needs of the restructuring of the Bulgarian economy .
I support the proposals that have been presented .
Further debt relief could lead to further distortions in aid allocation .
( FR ) It should not be forgotten that certain Members of this House , within their own families , may have known asylum seekers .
I do not therefore intend to repeat them .
Firstly , we must ensure that postal services are provided at affordable prices ; secondly , we must ensure that the services are of a high quality , and , thirdly , we must ensure that we are able to guarantee the availability of at least a minimum range of postal services in all parts of the European Union .
Moreover , as you are aware , all Community agreements now contain a specific human rights clause as an essential element .
Can I apologise to Mr Alavanos for not listening to the whole of his contribution .
We therefore need to examine ways of putting an end to such imbalances in transparency .
I endorse the amendment tabled by Mr <unk> of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group , which makes an indirect appeal for the ban on wearing the <unk> to be lifted .
The directive may well therefore raise hopes of cross-border consumer rights that it does not fulfil .
To conclude , this text provides the opportunity to match words with actions in supporting European research ; that is what we shall do tomorrow .
The next item is the report ( <unk> / 96 ) by Mrs <unk> <unk> , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on the proposal and amended proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the placing of <unk> products on the market ( COM ( 93 ) <unk> - <unk> / 93 ) and ( COM ( 95 ) <unk> - <unk> / <unk> / <unk> ( COD ) ) .
In addition , as far as possible , this aid needs to reach the most disadvantaged through free distribution .
That is why , Mr Van <unk> , we in Europe are united in saying &apos;no &apos; to unilateralism and &apos;yes &apos; to the implementation of international law .
A group of Members , including myself , recently had the opportunity to get closer to the situation and we met practically all of President <unk> &apos;s ministers , various social bodies and the main trade unions .
As you have heard , Parliament is unanimous on this issue and the vote in committee was almost unanimous .
There are two reasons for introducing this measure : firstly , efficiency – there are millions of vehicles registered in the EU and direct access will make it possible to check the legal status of a vehicle quickly and easily ; and secondly , transparency – at the moment , the various Member States have different ways of checking whether a vehicle has been stolen , at the moment when it is being registered .
Let us put an end to this <unk> which creates divisions between countries and peoples by pulling together instead .
The citizen must always be shown ways in which he can assert his rights as a citizen of the Union .
For the sake of <unk> , I can also report that this matter has not yet been discussed at all within the Council .
Mr President , on the McCarthy report .
The Commissioner for External Relations announced that she intends to propose to the College of Commissioners that a standing rapid response force be set up at European level to intervene in the event of natural disasters and humanitarian crises all over the world .
The constant increase in human activity has given rise to an increase in greenhouse gases .
As regards the EU &apos;s cooperation with the Middle East at a political level , we must continue to make every effort to help build autonomous and independent institutions for the Palestinian people .
Mr President , both the <unk> report and the Sakellariou report take us forward in a very positive direction .
And if these countries succeed in further improving their cooperation , or even integration , I think that it must also be taken into account in the relations they have with the European Union .
In the year 2000 there will be more than 50 million of them in the European Union , so more than one million Alzheimer patients .
To do otherwise will place EU food <unk> at a massive competitive disadvantage on world markets .
Although it was stated that the agreements reached in Berlin could not be changed , we have managed to obtain a further EUR 1 <unk> million for Category 3 , which would remain - so to speak - at the 1999 level in terms of constant prices , and a further EUR 1.1 billion for administrative expenditure .
In my view , that is the context surrounding this Commission communication , in which the next financial perspective must address the new circumstances .
I especially agree with her observation that the Union still has not enough data protection rules to deal with third pillar matters .
We must not <unk> out unpleasant issues .
The report makes very welcome proposals here .
We must also realise that <unk> % of appropriations for the TEN have to be made available at national level .
Furthermore , we must lay down accompanying socio-economic measures in order to alleviate their possible consequences .
It is a prospect that runs the risk of discouraging and <unk> people from using the net and e-commerce .
However , there are a number of dangers and risks and in particular , I want to deal with two aspects .
The Council - and Mr <unk> <unk> has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time , it is true , being in November 1999 , and also on other occasions , such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results .
<unk> working outside their own countries would retain a close link with their countries of origin through their national businesses .
We are bringing Europe to the people .
It appears from our programming discussions with the South African Government that we will have a limited number of major sectoral programmes which we think have to be discussed in any case with the Member States .
We also work well with our partners at multilateral level .
They must pay compensation for the wrong they have done .
The <unk> must be allowed to define certain areas of policy as being essentially domestic in that they have no direct impact on the internal affairs of other Member States .
– Mr President , in order to guarantee social inclusion , we must ensure the existence of a public social security system founded on the principles of democracy , solidarity and universal access and a health care system that is similarly public and universal .
I support them all and hope that they will be adopted by the assembly .
This implies waste with low <unk> .
This means that the environmental benefit from freight trains and inland waterway vessels is completely back to what it used to be , something with which we in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance are delighted .
This will help the Union to devise a medium- and long-term strategy designed to reduce emissions in industrialised countries by 15 to 30 % by the year 2020 .
<unk> steps must be taken at the Luxembourg Summit to ensure that the battle against unemployment can be won .
Thank you for your suggestion .
So it is an important instrument , especially at this delicate stage in history when , to respect the Maastricht criteria for the single currency , all the Member States are occupied with the very serious problem of health expenditure , which has now become <unk> .
It is true , as the report indicates , that it has not been possible to establish a climate of mutual trust between the parties and that recently the enemies of peace have placed obstacles and raised pretexts in the aim of making the <unk> unworkable , but our duty is to continue trying to achieve it in the immediate , in the medium term and in the long term .
Having to submit an amended report twice in order to gain sufficient support struck me as being no mean <unk> .
The Northern Dimension will have a favourable impact on economic cooperation and infrastructure building , and the stepping up of cooperation in the field of home affairs and justice is likely to increase security where cross-border issues are concerned .
To sum up , public finances must be consolidated , but it is only worthwhile doing so <unk> and provided that this goes hand in hand with the strengthening of the European economy and the skills of its citizens .
The Council continues to act in accordance with the terms of the July declaration whereby the financial perspective should be negotiated in a spirit of <unk> institutional cooperation , with the institutions willing to take all measures necessary for successful completion of the procedure leading to its adoption .
I know , Mr President , that you share my views in this regard .
On the other hand , there have been contradictory decisions , particularly in the area of freedom of expression where , for example , journalists continue to be prosecuted and , on occasion , convicted , for expressing certain <unk> opinions .
Mr President , aid which is conditional on the acquisition of goods or services originating in the donor country has repeatedly been condemned as an immoral and inefficient practice by recipient countries and the <unk> NGOs on the one hand , and on the other by the majority of agencies involved in development issues .
It seems to me , in contrast to the alternative amendment from the PSE Group - Amendment No 8 - to be more <unk> , <unk> and to be very much along the lines of what you , Mr President , have asked .
By contrast , I disagree with Mr <unk> , who said that this policy was a failure .
Even though , a <unk> , I am for the time being inclined to vote in favour , I shall wait to see the results of the voting before finally making up my mind .
I hope that will enjoy the support of the House .
Does the representative of the country holding the presidency stand by this definition , and on what measure of <unk> with Finnish affairs can it possibly be based ?
Mr President , I too must join in the <unk> of congratulations and say , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group , that we support the report and think that a good proposal has been made better .
I do not think that an additional meeting of the competent committee would be of much benefit , and would not really allow the situation to be clarified .
That is the most important aspect , that is what this is all about , and this Regulation constitutes a step forward in this respect .
– The mask has <unk> !
Furthermore , the Council established a new open method of coordination which encourages Member States to work together to improve the impact on social inclusion of policies in fields such as social protection , employment , health , housing and education .
Madam President , Mr <unk> , working time is an extremely sensitive issue .
Of course , this <unk> in fact has the disadvantage that it <unk> national parliaments of a part of their <unk> .
We must adopt a more positive approach .
One such case is the discussion on global public goods .
We therefore propose a European policy to combat terrorism in order to guarantee respect for collective and individual human rights , the right to life , freedom of expression , freedom of movement , ideological freedom and religious freedom : a European policy that <unk> terrorism in order to make collective security compatible with individual freedom and dignity .
Please allow me , Mrs Zana , to use your own words and welcome you in your own language , in Kurdish : In an important section of the Green Paper , all interested parties are invited to make a firm case for their stance on the need for revision .
If this were even slightly true , we would vote in favour of this report , but we have our doubts , because the main sector mentioned as destined to receive a restructuring benefit of EUR 15 million is the South African wines and spirits sector .
They have plenty of room to do this with the minimum rates that we have proposed .
However , we can accept Amendment No 40 - which Mrs Maes mentioned a moment ago - because it makes our position more flexible and means that we offer quantities which may be more balanced .
It will also have a favourable effect on the European industry &apos; s competitive position within the global market and this aspect too has been stressed by a number of Members in this House .
In our view , the UN should have effective diplomatic instruments at its disposal and be capable of exercising preventive diplomacy and giving early warnings in respect of potential conflicts .
The Commission &apos;s proposal amending this directive is aimed , first and foremost , at increasing the number of exemptions .
So when this problem is discussed in the House , I shall urge that the priority projects should be respected .
Again I agree with her .
I feel that Parliament , with a few legitimate exceptions , is calling for greater courage from the Commission , and I would therefore like to thank the honourable Member for her report , which makes the Commission &apos;s communication totally clear and more effective .
For example , the amendments on <unk> offences , exceeding the 50 <unk> limit on discards , are frankly unacceptable .
I visited six sites around Europe where decommissioning activities and research into them are taking place .
The Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party is of course in favour of humanitarian aid for North Korea .
Every delegation now has to submit an audit plan , which is intended to ensure adequate supervision of aid programmes .
The Commission is now proposing that money spent on these commitments should come from existing EU funds .
I just emphasised in my reply that in my opinion it is of course very important , and indeed it is part of the reason we need agricultural reform , to ask whether the money we spend on agriculture - at European , national and , in federal Member States , regional level - is always spent in such a way , because of the way the system is organised , that it really benefits those on the farms .
If this report also leads to that then the SMEs , Madam Rapporteur , will be <unk> grateful .
That is the purpose of the first <unk> meetings on drugs now taking place in Lille , with the participation of our Belgian neighbours .
I would ask the Commissioner , Mrs Diamantopoulou , to seek some initiative which will contribute to resolving this problem .
I would like to make one further comment .
The general sentiment seems to be in favour of overriding the Rules of Procedure and it is my great pleasure to give the floor to Mr Hernández <unk> .
Thank you , Mrs Thyssen .
I think that the proposal from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is reasonable .
You and your political groups are a unique example of political party cooperation that extends across national borders .
Consequently , minors accompany the asylum application of the adult and <unk> minors are transferred , according to the wording that I propose , to a State where they have any relative willing and able to look after them .
Furthermore the proposal put forward by Mr Crowley would require a change of the <unk> which at present - as I am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business .
This will deprive you of a much more complete explanation , but please allow me nevertheless to thank Mrs <unk> on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for her magnificent work and her willingness to take up all the suggestions of that committee .
My point is that we must not forget that human rights are being violated .
The signature of this Convention is certainly compatible with the preparation of a binding Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I also call upon the Commission - and I know that Commissioner Patten is one of the best Commissioners we have - to make a huge effort here and ensure that the whole host of announcements made by the States - not the EU , the individual States that is - actually <unk> .
Also , a number of people have already said that we want concrete , <unk> reports so that we know where we stand , and reports which are easy to read .
The Presidency also wishes to thank the Commission for its efforts and for its input , throughout the legislative process , of valuable technical knowledge without which the Code would never have seen the light of day .
But the effects of the employment intensification process of growth are not immediate .
Mr <unk> <unk> , I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question , and I would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future .
The vote is concluded .
Clearly , this can hardly be interpreted as anything other than an <unk> that Mr <unk> did something he ought not to have done and that he might perhaps even deserve a <unk> .
We are not working in an empty field ; the European Convention on Human Rights lays down some standards .
In order to put our house in order , therefore , the Union &apos; s main concern must be to agree in Nice , at the end of the year , upon a high-quality institutional reform which will prevent our system from being watered down .
In addition , I would stress the need for good design of these <unk> to ensure they are comprehensible to all users throughout the Union , which is not easy when dealing with technical material like this in many different languages .
In my view , what is happening with the captain of the is rather nasty , and I hope that we will be able to talk to him again shortly .
<unk> can help alleviate the burden of the regions of origin and consequently enhance their protection capacity .
In my opinion , and certain Members have <unk> this problem , we must not look for <unk> or pay attention to the problem of the nuclear tests in India .
That should be <unk> .
Let me address a couple more aspects .
However , when this system is applied , it unfortunately only partially <unk> for the disadvantage , thereby weakening the position of European industry not only on the world market , but on our own market as well .
That is all .
However , we must continue to insist on weapon inspectors being admitted .
The importance of these efforts is underlined by the work that the Commission has done for the summit conference which is taking place in Luxembourg at the moment ; but also for the implementation of the European employment strategy and for the guidelines for employment which will be a result of that process .
The political aspect on which the European Union should really forcefully insist is the withdrawal of the Israeli army of occupation to within its internationally recognised borders , that is to say the 1967 borders .
I think that Mr Rothley &apos; s report should be adopted in its entirety : it is a high-level compromise , the synthesis of a series of <unk> and innovative concepts , and the result of the cooperation between the various institutions .
We must not disregard the importance of protecting the education and the vocational reintegration of young <unk> and women and sport is becoming a genuinely important part of the Youth programme .
After independence in Zimbabwe , the <unk> House Agreement between Britain , as the colonial power , and Zimbabwe allowed for land redistribution to black families and appropriate compensation to white farmers without any loss of production .
My group is deeply worried that corruption remains widespread and that much work must be done to implement the acquis in justice and home affairs .
In keeping with this small degree of <unk> , at odds with the <unk> of international conflict researchers , alliances for combating terrorism are being entered into with the world &apos; s most effective <unk> terrorists .
The second reason is legal .
As a representative of the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I naturally stand for competition in this area .
Mr President , in the fight against international crime and terrorism , there is already cooperation between the Member States of the European Union and the United States as regards information and this has produced significant results .
I most strongly advise against that course .
Mr President , I would like to ask the Commissioner if she would reply to the safety factor which is <unk> .
In my view , therefore , in all our very proper moves towards liberalization , we need to take account of the possible problems or negative consequences to which these moves may give rise .
In the European Union , we can move towards stricter specifications and enhanced control and prevention roles ; at the same time , without being against the liberalisation of the <unk> , we believe that , because of this liberalisation , additional controls are needed by national civil aviation authorities and additional controls by your Commission of the Member States &apos; national civil aviation authorities .
We would therefore like to enter into a dialogue with these other groups , because we are not against debate and discussions , we actually want a debate .
We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means .
I believe that our efforts in this area were very successful .
The Minutes for this sitting will be subject to the approval of Parliament at the beginning of the next part-session Thirdly , the creation of <unk> &apos; to be used in common by the Union and other international organizations concerned with education and youth , such as the Council of Europe , UNESCO or the OECD , would be a powerful means of achieving the cooperation that is much discussed but little practised .
Mr Hernández <unk> has the floor .
The <unk> of the University of Istanbul is standing up and talking about 135 000 dead in order to occupy both Cyprus and Greece .
It was the founding spirit of Robert Schuman that <unk> through the Brussels Summit .
The Commission is grateful to the European Parliament for making , for the first time , in its 1996 budget , a specific heading of ECU <unk> allotted to <unk> .
However , the fact of having made that decision opens up <unk> in other areas .
These statements confirm the concerns expressed within my country that this Charter is intended to be the preamble to a European Constitution .
But this is a very specific statement .
Thus the substance of the action must have a legal base .
Human rights are an <unk> for all human beings of whatever gender , and neither culture nor tradition can excuse the violation of women ’ s fundamental rights .
Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy It would therefore be easier if we took the written explanations first .
The common position now contains a package of measures for improved <unk> emission control , but there is still a number of amendments in the report which define time limits and the details of the regulations more precisely .
Madam President-in-Office , my closing point concerns a very sad and dramatic situation emanating from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
Thank you , Commissioner .
( <unk> / 97 ) by Mr Cunha , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol defining , for the period from 3 May 1966 to 2 May 1999 , the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Angola on fishing off the coast of Angola ( COM ( 96 ) <unk> - <unk> / 96-96 / <unk> ( CNS ) ) ; - ( <unk> / 96 ) by Mr Macartney , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol establishing , for the period 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1997 , the fishing rights and financial compensation provided for in the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of Guinea on fishing off the <unk> coast ( COM ( 96 ) <unk> - <unk> / 96-96 / <unk> ( CNS ) ) .
It cannot be that we have two different ways of dealing with things .
Mr President , the initiative that was taken on 20 September 2004 in New York , with Lula and Annan playing the leading parts , contains good ideas about aid , trade debts , cancellation and new forms of financing .
Mr President , in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , on behalf of which I speak here , there have been serious concerns that the Council might not manage to arrive at decisions in time to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the European Union and that the relevant legal instruments would then automatically become part of the third pillar .
Madam President , first and foremost I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Thyssen , and express my own words of appreciation for the cooperation we have enjoyed over the years .
That is unacceptable .
In the future , the EU has to take more obvious account of the impact all its work has on the implementation of human rights .
In our view , the preparations for the forthcoming round of international trade negotiations is not at all satisfactory as regards procedure , and this is due to at least three reasons .
They should be ashamed .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr <unk> , I would like to start with Ukraine , having been rather surprised that the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine , which is an annual event nearly caused us in Europe to treat it as a European gas crisis .
Not enough <unk> Community citizens take part in European and local elections in every country of the European Union .
Proposal for a Council decision on an exchange of letters between the European Community and the United Nations <unk> and <unk> Agency for Palestine Refugees in the <unk> East ( <unk> ) concerning additional funding in 2001 under the current <unk> Convention for the years <unk> &#91; COM ( 2001 ) <unk> - <unk> / 2001 - 2001 / <unk> ( CNS ) &#93; Not if we can help it , Commissioner !
We know the list is incomplete and that Member States have not found it possible to identify , when shipments are presented for clearance , what products they contain .
<unk> a so-called gentlemen &apos; s agreement , Parliament and the Council have agreed not to monitor each other &apos; s spending .
It is then important , for the euro &apos;s stability , not to <unk> of these surpluses in one fell <unk> .
I hope that all involved will regard that as a serious incentive to work intensively and constructively with Mr <unk> and Mr <unk> , the United States representative , in the coming days .
The initiative being taken here by the Commission and Parliament will , I believe , improve safety .
An examination of the agricultural proposals of the Santer <unk> , presented to us on 18 March last , raises a great many questions about the future of the CAP .
They will be here until 7 p. m . Some of the procedures dating from the last parliamentary term have still not been <unk> to this day .
Sweden has also violated the Treaty by introducing qualified majority voting as a method of taking decisions on future changes to the rules governing confidentiality .
I think that this would be in everyone &apos;s interest .
By what , Mr Titley , do you justify your assertion that our orders of business here in Strasbourg are not full ?
We have agreed on Amendment No 3 . .
How can we accept maritime transport , which is vital for our trade and commerce , being developed to the detriment of environmental and human safety ?
The Commission &apos;s interest in precisely this area led it to propose a comitology procedure to determine the <unk> for access to such data .
Parliament must therefore welcome the Commission ’ s initiative and play a proactive and constructive part in improving on what it is proposing .
<unk> are just something that they comply with if it <unk> them , but not if they do not .
This applies primarily to Madeira and the Azores , and the relevant comments of the Court of Auditors reveal a whole series of operational failures and weaknesses , which a rapid check of the programme might confirm .
All employees are covered , except for seamen .
We ensure that we are kept up to date with the latest scientific advice .
<unk> mobility is an important issue .
The Green Group votes against the recommendation on the Cohesion Fund Regulation because most of the innovative requests expressed by the European Parliament in the first reading aiming to strengthen and integrate the role of the Cohesion Fund within the European structural policy have not been taken into serious consideration in the new regulation .
I would like to express my very real gratitude to you for this commitment and the accompanying flexibility and willingness to seek joint solutions , and at the same time to ask you : please do all you can to bring the ongoing legislative procedures to a speedy conclusion as quickly as possible .
We cannot <unk> the negative effects of the fact that these objectives are not being achieved in the Union .
Unless this component is complied with , the double <unk> condition would also be <unk> for these offences , which is exactly what we are trying to avoid .
How will progress from Johannesburg onwards be achieved ?
The contribution of the European Parliament is very important .
Ladies and gentlemen , we must now consider some amendments to the agenda for today and tomorrow .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is able to support the rapporteur &apos;s and the Commission &apos;s proposals .
We take the view that a clause should be incorporated into the contracts and agreements to exclude from the award of future contracts those partners guilty of any fraudulent act .
Although the Council Presidency has said it is a matter for Member States , and has passed the buck , it would have been interesting to hear whether there are any approaches which it would be worth pursuing .
The UN Economic Commission for Europe recently sounded a warning against similar illusions regarding the eastward expansion of the EU .
It is important to give victims adequate information about their rights , and society must be made more sensitive in dealing with crimes of violence against women , children and young people .
<unk> Chair , I have heard that answer , and it does not convince me that these minimum standards are going to be raised at this Seville meeting of the Millennium Round .
I therefore welcome this report - for which , once again , I thank Mr <unk> - as a further step towards ensuring that the new European framework will be the best it possibly can be , and in ensuring that it is introduced on time so as not to disadvantage European institutions .
According to the motion for a resolution , these partnerships have to meet certain conditions .
Perhaps this was a reaction to Europe &apos; s <unk> , <unk> political stance in relation to the warring factions .
The railway package ’ s four rapporteurs – Mr Jarzembowski , who was responsible for the report on the development of the Community ’ s railways ; Mr Savary , who was rapporteur for the report on a European <unk> Agency ; Mr <unk> Sterckx , who was responsible for the report on safety on the Community ’ s railways ; and Mrs <unk> , who was responsible for the report on the interoperability of the trans-European rail system – have all helped <unk> life into the European railway sector .
<unk> is important as well , to avoid speculative transactions <unk> this intervention .
I should like to make a comment here , if I may .
Secondly , I would take up the rapporteur &apos;s point concerning the right of <unk> and the need - especially in certain areas - to harmonise the different Member States &apos; systems .
Without the directive , however , the <unk> West would have been a lot <unk> Therefore , Commissioner , although there is apparently a <unk> of diversity in this House , I can guarantee that we are very close together .
Thus , in our countries , there is still a great deal to do so that our citizens understand the profound meaning of the EU enlargement .
This matter requires in-depth examination .
On this score , we should first of all highlight the difference between the 1994 report and the later one .
However , it must be expressly interpreted as a condition of entry for the countries of central and eastern Europe .
We have to act now if we want summer <unk> and fine weather to be experienced as sources of pleasure , rather than sources of air pollution and threats to human health and the environment .
Mr President , our discussions have <unk> exclusively on the broad <unk> , and , whilst these are , of course , very important , the problems lie in the detail .
When we get to Amendment No 16 we should make sure that it is changed .
A front could be developed to demand a change of direction .
The aim is to move to a new stage in Turkey &apos;s preparation for approximation to the acquis , taking into account the extent to which the country has complied with the Copenhagen political criteria , and with a view to setting new objectives in the accession process .
This House believes that it is important for the same priorities to apply in foreign policy as have done to date .
It is inconsistency , however , and those declarations that are sometimes heard even here in Parliament but are not confirmed by events , which are today the main reasons for the gap between Europe and its institutions and Europe ’ s citizens .
Therefore , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy have put down amendments to the Garosci Report showing ways that we can get around the abuse of the system within airports , ports and airlines .
If not , I very much fear that the consequences for the current budget and for subsequent budgets will be considerable and the responsibility for this will lie with everybody .
It is true that there have been some translation problems , but as far as I know , the texts submitted to the vote and for your attention are available in all languages .
If a majority of so-called <unk> European &apos; MEPs protect these so-called <unk> &apos; , so often implicated in <unk> scandals , from the law , it is because , in fact , despite all the speeches they may make , they all share a certain idea of Europe : one where tax havens , arms dealers and oil companies <unk> supreme , a political world that is <unk> by money , and a contempt for justice and for the sovereignty of the African peoples , the <unk> victims of this <unk> for oil &apos; trafficking .
This requires strong and <unk> partnership with the United States .
We have today voted in favour of the Carnero González report on the Czech Republic , since we wish to express our full support for enlargement .
And now you are asking for a charter on the new criteria !
It is important that the trade unions should play a central role in the achievement of equal pay and it is therefore crucial , as the communication points out , that women should be involved in the negotiation of agreements .
I know many in this Parliament appear to believe in this latter , but surely this example once again shows that there is a need for legislation .

Political attitudes and feelings in general are seldom a match for expert qualifications .
This is Mr <unk> <unk> gun &apos; or whatever he called it .

It says , for example , that we need &apos;a strengthening of a sense of community &apos; through the promotion of <unk> , <unk> , schools , churches and leisure associations &apos; .
The human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements constitutes one of the instruments of this policy .
I will summarise the progress made in three points , and I would like to welcome you Madam Vice-President .
Perhaps the latter could in those circumstances go on language courses at some stage .

The action by successive Commissioners was extremely wrong and against the interests of public <unk>
The Commission strategy decisively influenced the action of the Member States and delayed the adoption of effective measures in the field of animal health and scientific research into the causes of the disease and its <unk>
The United Kingdom Government is clearly responsible because of the way in which it allowed the explosion of the disease and in particular the way in which it <unk> from the other Member States the true dimension of the <unk>
The process demonstrated the lack of operational effectiveness of the Commission farming structures entrusted with controlling animal health and its effects on public health , its lack of scientific thoroughness and transparency .
As regards consumer protection - we are dealing here with paragraph 23 of Mr <unk> &apos;s resolution and this subject was of course touched on in the report from Mr Pérez Royo - I would like to come back to you , Mr Commissioner .
Mr President , I wish first of all to pay tribute to the work carried out by Mr Brok .
I am glad to hear that both the presidency and the Commission also take this line .
The Commission can accept in part and / or principle <unk> amendments , and they are Nos 2 , 5 , 10 , 16 , 20 , 27 , 35 , 38 , 42 , 45 , 47 , 49 , 57 , 60 to 62 , 67 , 69 , 70 , 73 , 75 , 76 , 80 , 82 to 85 , 92 , 93 , 96 , 98 , 106 , 107 , 108 , 112 to <unk> , 120 , 126 , <unk> , 134 , 144 , 149 , 150 , 154 to 156 , 160 , <unk> , 170 , 177 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , 220 and <unk> .
As Commissioner for research and innovation , I submitted proposals and the Commission will present a document , but it is clear that there will be a major political debate next year and up until 2006 .
Madam President , the Commission thanks Mr Colom i Naval for his very thorough work and warmly welcomes the proposed resolution of the European Parliament on the Commission &apos;s <unk> 2000 programme , which is , of course , a tangible expression of President Santer &apos;s pledge to this House in January last year to change the financial and administrative culture of the Commission .

This repressive situation is one <unk> example proving the lack of democracy in Burma .
<unk> it is not really so far from Strasbourg to Johannesburg .
However , let us use the time between now and then to clarify our thoughts and to agree as far as possible on the best way forward .
In short , everyone needs to stop <unk> around like <unk> chickens and start examining this matter with a degree of objectivity .
It is therefore necessary to use this <unk> cooperation strategy to implement a policy which takes into consideration a certain number of the Rio commitments .
We have to make States aware that the commitments made at the Councils are truly binding and also that the issue of employment is the main objective of the Lisbon strategy .
When we reach the relevant points in the vote , the House can indicate its preference .
This is money well spent and we in the Liberal , Democratic and <unk> Group support both the communication and the report wholeheartedly .
( Parliament adopted the resolution ) That is the final objective .
Without any common indicators , no serious assessment can be made of the measures taken by the Member States .
With a binding , cross-border ban on the <unk> of pigs , pig breeders and the market could , in my view , adapt perfectly well to the resultant changes .
We must have a record on human rights which is as good as that of the United States .
We can , however , do a lot to improve energy efficiency .
We must , however , stress that times are changing .
I believe that companies have the right to choose workers freely but they should firstly take on those workers who have already been doing certain jobs and whose employment contracts are still in force .
That question is one to be dealt with under the Treaty , but we are getting some clear internal guidelines about what procedures we can use in Parliament .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , the German Presidency has , of course , been overshadowed by the war in Kosovo , but that is all the more reason for keeping in mind that the Presidency of the Council , for which the German Federal Government was answerable , was only able to maintain its position in this matter because it had the <unk> support of the Parties of the Union , whilst your own supporters , Mr <unk> , would have taken pleasure in <unk> your <unk> from under you , had you still been wearing them of course .
Concerning an appeal , I understand his caution , but he said that we can make an appeal .
For the same reason , where the relevant conventions are not in force , the Commission does not support the notion of waiting for five years before the directive is applicable .
The Council of 16 October also expressed the hope that the European Parliament should be in a position to give its opinion on this subject as quickly as possible .
Finally , the Commission also aims to promote support for the new generation of vehicles and alternative fuels , and we will soon present a communication on alternative fuels , which has been discussed here , and a directive in which we will put forward a proposal on the minimum level of use of biofuels and another on tax relief measures to encourage the use of biofuels .
That concludes Question Time .
Madam President , much less vehemently but , I believe , just as justifiably , I would like to ask this Parliament to vote in favour of this urgent motion .
I am absolutely delighted that the matter of the two-stage procedure has been described in greater detail .
However , I must stress that the efficient implementation of national provisions transposing Community directives , especially those relating to the employer &apos;s duty to report accidents sustained by employees at work is a matter for national governments .
Madam President , I do not think that Mrs Banotti should be <unk> today because she has laid on two Dutch TV channels .
Having said this , we also want this dialogue to have an objective basis , as have the declarations of the new President , <unk> <unk> , to which , however , the People &apos; s Republic of China has replied with a renewed display of <unk> , arrogance and a <unk> for democracy .
I think this is within the <unk> of possibility and we should like to see the Presidency of the European Union adopting a clearer stance on this issue .
I think it shows that we have moved very much closer in the essential things that are important to us all .
In terms of substance , a list of issues was drawn up at Turin without indicating effective solutions for the great challenges at home and abroad : unemployment , lack of unity in foreign policy , lack of results in the common struggle against organized crime and drugs , lack of any effective will to build political unity , at least in parallel with economic union .
Some people described it as the ship of unemployment , the <unk> ship ; nevertheless , a prominent business leader pointed out that our great challenge was to ensure that that ship did not return to China empty , but full of our products for that immense and growing market .
Rather , we feel that this matter requires action and that is why we have taken the trouble to draft this report .
Portugal has run her course in Macao and is fortunate that her honour during this passage has been in the hands of <unk> <unk> and his officials in the Government of Macao .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure ) We must also ask the Israeli Government , which has the most strength in political , moral and military terms , to fulfil its part of the <unk> , dismantling the illegal settlements in the occupied territories and putting an end to the policy of selective assassinations .
Mr Caudron &apos;s report rightly emphasizes the quality of the working document drafted by the Commission &apos;s services on &quot; The competitiveness of European Industry &apos; .
Mr President , every time we hear in this Parliament about the denial of basic human rights , like the right to vote or the right to stand for election , it should serve to strengthen our own resolve to promote and improve democracy in all parts of the world .
Commissioner , I recognise the delicacy of the issue at the moment but I did ask you a couple of specific questions .
Nonetheless , this is very typical of Israelis ’ <unk> and behaviour .
Secondly , the new &quot; in &quot; word is flexibility .
We would have liked to see the guarantee extended for up to five years ; that would have meant that the principle of sustainability was finally also introduced de facto .

We are , I think , agreed that electronic means of communication are developing at such <unk> speed that we too must act very quickly in setting up the legal framework for this new type of communication .
Where the Commission says <unk> them &apos; , Mr Herman says <unk> them off &apos; .
It is important to initiate debate in the Member States and the national parliaments about this agreement .
So far five main in-depth meetings of the preparatory group have been held , together with three meetings of the IGC itself .
He has put his finger on a number of problems which should prompt reflection by all interested parties .
The European Parliament has extended an invitation to the representatives of the associated Mediterranean countries and it is my intention that the foreign ministers should definitely confirm the creation of the European Parliamentary Forum in La <unk> .

When this regulation is put into tangible form , however , we must keep a careful eye on its precise final content .
Mr Wijsenbeek wishes to speak on a point of order .
It is with concern that we observe bottlenecks , especially within the centralised management framework .
And when will the Commission present this to the Council ?
Far from taking account of the popular sentiment expressed at the recent referendums in France and the Netherlands , and not content with the already controversial opening of accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia , the Commission and the Member States have developed a genuine passion for opening up the European Union .
This trust is based on their experience or on their understanding of European law and the impact thereof on their day-to-day lives .
A report like that , with a consensus in this Parliament , may not be <unk> , but the intention is to present a report which applies to the whole of the Union and not just to one Member State , and which sets out guidelines for a common policy .
The figures are as follows ; 7 000 deaths in the immediate aftermath of the disaster , and up to 30 000 deaths over the 20 years which followed , with over 100 000 having fallen ill to date .
I hope very much that the Commission will have listened very carefully indeed to the point made by my colleague Mr Morris whose amendments I profoundly support .
With the advent of so many privately <unk> television channels , public service television has undergone real and dramatic changes in recent years .
<unk> have rights and , more than anything , they have the right to be informed at the time when a problem arises .

We have had an intensive period with a great deal of internal responsibilities .
From the Lisbon Summit I hope we will get a clearer idea as to how the Union budget can contribute to our common objective of creating new jobs in the continent .
The second point is that we tend to <unk> , and that causes problems .
At a meeting which I , unfortunately , was unable to attend , my group decided by a majority to support Amendment No 25 .
It was the outcome of complicated work which gave us a barely adequate compromise .
Recital <unk> and recommendation No 3 state this explicitly , and Amendment No 2 , tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , is also negative evidence of this for , if it were to be adopted , this amendment would have Parliament believe that where the democratic and Constitutional structure of a country is working properly there is no terrorism .
In this report I have proposed - and the committee has broadly accepted - a suggestion that Eurocontrol should be a regulatory body with more powers , more effective sanctions and with the right of appeal for those who are affected by it .
As regards access to records , I agree , it is just a question of finding the right wording .
We were told to arrive here for votes at noon .

The report <unk> a proposal for deregulation but , at the same time , harmonisation of the permitted size of food packaging .
What we are dealing with in Darfur is genocide , which should be unequivocally condemned by the UN .
So the Council is not willing to go further in its assessment than is the case today .
I would nevertheless like to tell Commissioner Diamantopoulou , who works so hard to help workers and to increase the number of jobs throughout Europe , that , as representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party , I believe that , if we are to have more jobs , we must reduce the cost of labour : we must , therefore , reduce the cost of pension services and contributions while still increasing the size of pensions .
Because what the term <unk> communication &apos; really refers to , in principle , is that the European Commission has tackled the issue of advertising law in the European single market .
I want to ask you , Madam President , if you would ask <unk> from the Commission or one of the Commissioners to come here to address Parliament and say what exactly we are doing to stop the terrible <unk> taking place in Chechnya .
It is no use confining ourselves to a diagnosis of the current tragic situation and a <unk> of its <unk> prospects , however .
After all , women are equal to men and deserve respect for their talents .
As a result of these terrible events we are today to set new standards and doubtless increase the cost of transporting dangerous goods by sea .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I really do not want to start without thanking our rapporteur , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , for the truly outstanding work he has done with this report , but , today , I want also to thank Mrs Redondo , who chaired the committee on foot and mouth disease and who managed it with a great deal of <unk> .
Just like my fellow members of the Czech Civil Democratic Party ( <unk> ) , I voted against this report .
Like others Members who have spoken on this subject , I hope Article 151 , on culture , can also be a legal basis for this audiovisual programme .
I believe that you can achieve implementation of this regulation by 1 September if you accept our amendments .
This is partly due to delays in reaching agreement with the International Monetary Fund on the economic programme .
On no account must the new means of communication be looked at independently of the information that is transmitted .
I do not blame Austrian voters , I blame the political parties which , with great facility , sometimes say what the people want to hear and play on the sentiments of exclusion and racism .
Industry is right , of course , in saying that reuse should not be a front for protectionism .
Even the way the Convention works , however , is a bad example and a bad <unk> for the future : its functions are subordinate to the supreme <unk> of its President and to what I might <unk> <unk> , a form of democracy without elections , where not a single vote has taken place .
Similarly , it is good that Mr Barroso , the President-designate , has drawn the political lessons he needed to draw from the debate .
That does not mean that we cannot regard the use of sanctions as something positive but those sanctions have to be applied in the context of the international community and according to rules accepted by everyone .
At the same time , the Union must ensure that citizens can continue to enjoy their fundamental freedoms and travel freely within the Union .
Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media I should like to congratulate Mrs Lalumière on her excellent report .
I therefore heartily support Mrs Redondo Jiménez &apos;s idea that it makes perfect sense to maintain specific measures for fire protection and rural development .
This is an exciting programme - and I congratulate everyone involved - but it has a much broader dimension : Europe is about more than the movement of money , capital and goods or a single currency or the Economic Union , it is about people .
When regions are so <unk> from the continental <unk> , trying to automatically apply the tax and customs rules that are applied in the continental <unk> would mean putting those outermost regions at a disadvantage .
The amendments on selective fishing gear are very much in line with what the sector can achieve in practical terms .
Madam President , first of all I should like to make it clear that the European Union was the first and last to give help to the countries of the former Yugoslavia in their time of need .
This is the path we must take to safeguard our people : we must follow it <unk> , resolutely and responsibly .
Using the example of Europol , many Members wanted to show that we are still very far from a common policy on police cooperation .
The exchange of raw materials and product information has fostered development .
We wanted to use this guarantee fund to make up for this deficiency and if we want fine words to become reality it will depend on this guarantee fund also becoming reality .
He has played his proper part as a European official .
However , that has nothing to do with flags of convenience .
The most <unk> point is the formulation on self-handling , which is also to include what is done on land .
In any case , as the Presidency takes every opportunity to point out , this first round of negotiations in the Council is only a first round , and Parliament ’ s agreement is also required if we are to have Financial Perspectives .
The inclusion of existing plants is a major improvement on former legislation .
As a result of increased pressure , there has been a certain degree acceleration since then .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased to report to this House today that the Commission is highly satisfied with the overall results of the Helsinki European Council .
Then we would definitely have to give consideration to the real results .
The Commission is aware that the Polish soft fruit sector has had major problems in the last two years , <unk> to the low prices of several of the products in question .
We cannot say that we need 70 million immigrants in order to make progress with our economy and then discriminate against them .
The contest tomorrow is free movement of goods <unk> environmental protection - it is a fundamentally European question , which is why I call on you to vote in favour of the report .
We expect that the Romanian authorities will inform all the applicants individually .
Mrs Buitenweg , the <unk> Group will support you and your report .
But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions , as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries .
As I was saying , we examine the competition and , in this context , the viewpoint of dependent workers and their representatives may take on greater importance if it concerns the effects of the operation on competition .
In 2002 , the Turkish authorities <unk> 2 <unk> <unk> of heroin .
We are aware that the common organization of the market in bananas is the result of a complex legislative procedure which seeks a balance between interests which do not always coincide .
Those are only some of the catches of course .
Parliament must have the legally binding right to refer a matter back for further consideration if things are moving in the wrong direction .
It is our duty to confront and overcome the problems of today &apos;s motor car so that we have increasingly suitable vehicles tomorrow .
That is only to be expected .
The Evans report , for its part , is no less topical or relevant .
<unk> will always be a concept which will complement future mandatory emission limits .
In the conciliation , it was , in particular , we in the Group of the European United Left , together with the Greens , who fought for the improvements which have now in fact been made , for example the gradual elimination of <unk> <unk> , greater transparency and better risk assessments .
There are good reasons why political action is so obviously required in this area .
We must open up this Parliament !
While I fully agree with the need for , and importance of , <unk> analysis I am obliged to recognise that there are problems with the data and with the statistical services in many Member States .
The report rejects the use of rigid instruments such as the scrapping of vessels , which have irreversible consequences and major socio-economic effects and prefers other , more flexible instruments for managing stocks .
For without adjusting the perspective in chapter IV , we will simply allow Africa or Asia to foot the bill once again for something we should attempt to set up ourselves in Yugoslavia in terms of democratic values .
I would like to ask you whether these three Member States who , in Amsterdam , made the reinforcement of the institutions an essential condition , and therefore a prerequisite , for the conclusion of preliminary accession negotiations , still maintain the reservations <unk> to the Treaty of Amsterdam , or whether they have <unk> their position in the meantime .
There is one other conclusion , however , that I cannot accept .
This is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean countries .
We are very disappointed with the current third pillar proposals , particularly those relating to judicial cooperation , criminal and civil matters , and the role of the European Public Prosecutor .
Others , meanwhile , have been concerned about the strengthening of the euro against the dollar , as was revealed , for example , in the interview Commissioner Solbes gave last Saturday .
Mr President , just a very brief word to Mr Schulz : please bring the statement you have just made to the attention of the German Minister for the Interior .
If a number of problems are to be solved , we have to approve the report tomorrow .
The same applies to <unk> risk , with Mr Caudron &apos; s and Mr <unk> &apos; s amendments , to fossil fuels and maybe also to <unk> and Mr <unk> &apos; s amendment .
So the Austrian Presidency must make sure it <unk> the right gear and steers in the right direction .
How do you assess the implementation of the first and second railway packages by the Member States and what steps will you take in order to accelerate this ?
These are the use of ingredients in processed products and the origin of raw materials .
Clearly the structural reforms mentioned mean more <unk> employment , globalised pensions and further <unk> .
We will be voting in favour of the proposal tomorrow .
These countries will , of course , become members of the European partners , the <unk> and UNICE , and they will participate in the social summit through their European institutions and organisations .
As those who spoke before me have pointed out , this problem has been pursuing us for a long time , and it must now be sorted out once and for all , as it is , above all , in the public &apos;s interest that there should be nothing that the Court of Auditors might criticise in future .
Mr President , thank you for your introduction and for the opportunity to address Parliament this afternoon .
<unk> of those funds in future should be made conditional on a binding commitment being given to invest in a given location for at least ten years , subject to an explicit agreement that the subsidies will be <unk> in the event that production is moved elsewhere .
One is the terrible events which have taken place in the name of the fight against terrorism .
I do not think that this is a valid solution .
These are the countries on which we are keeping a very close watch , as I mentioned earlier in connection with another matter .
Questions of human rights are a delicate issue .
This applies not only to new initiatives , for those that are already going through the system , along with legislation already in force , must also be evaluated in order to determine whether it really is needed or whether it costs too much .
Let us therefore state right now the future principles of a new CAP : a concern for quality , respect for the countryside , support for multifunctionality and the maintenance of a proper social balance in rural environments ; in short , the defence of the European agricultural model , undertaken through border protection and therefore funded by the consumer rather than through an endlessly expanding Community budget funded by the taxpayer .
In fact , Mr <unk> <unk> , the UN Special Representative , has repeatedly called for a rapid end to the war for this very reason .
With regard to the events of recent days , I would like to say - and I am saying this on the day , and the week , that the Intergovernmental Conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which , given what we have said about the Austrian crisis , I believe should be fully included in the Treaties .
What has been done about training ?
The European Fifteen have now not only <unk> the markets to a considerable extent but also taken over companies in the less advanced countries , thus producing not <unk> amounts of revenue .
While it is true that most people have done better out of globalisation this time round , with the combination of opening markets and technology .
The wording is of secondary importance .
These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings , primarily about our values .
Africa must not be a continent from which the <unk> understandably want to escape .
.
– We denounce this joint motion , which is a provocation to people the world over who are against the unjust imperialist war in Iraq and are fighting for peace .
This is currently not the case and the Commission has submitted a number of proposals to the Intergovernmental Conference , currently underway , which aim to improve cooperation in these matters .
It would be a first if problems were resolved ... by saving money .
In the Commission &apos; s view , it is positive , for at least three reasons .
I would like to thank Mrs <unk> and I shall now give the floor to Commissioner Patten .
However , as the panel of experts <unk> by Ambassador <unk> noted in April 1999 , the Iraqi population would not have suffered such <unk> had the measures taken in 1991 by the Security Council not had to have been extended .
It is only the Member States , though , that can ensure that Europe remains competitive at world level .
In the present context of the BSE crisis , it is high time to <unk> the exploitation of <unk> by farmers , enabling them to provide an agricultural benefit , maintaining the quality of animal production and ensuring the ecological management of the <unk> - all activities favourable to the global policy of sustainable development of the less favoured rural areas .
We are delighted by the way in which the rapporteur included our proposals , except for the omission of the proposal on the application of the Code of Good Administrative <unk> .
Obviously we need to look at the question of aid and how it can be reconciled with the rules of transparency .
We have common interests .
We are the European Parliament , and we wish to be regarded as such .
Mr President , I am sorry that my giving way to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten seems to have caused her some <unk> but I do not think she is any need of any blood products .
Mr President , I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report .
The Committee would like the Member States to start preventive work to prevent sexual harassment and for employers to be obliged to create working conditions in which sexual harassment is unlikely .
I speak here as someone who was chief executive of the National <unk> Agency in the United Kingdom .
In the minute I have , let me say that the European Union &apos; s Mediterranean policy lacks strategy , and it lacks a timetable and clear objectives in contrast , if you will , to its policy on Eastern Europe .
It was a necessary and right thing to do , as it allowed us to have the first real negotiations at the political level on industrial goods and services , anti-dumping rules and development .
This pragmatic approach allowed for a more favourable position on behalf of the Member States on a potential fresh proposal compared to the position they took in 1998 on the previous proposal which still remains on the table in the Council .
Could it perhaps be the case that differences of opinion in the board of Commissioners and pressure from some Member States have combined to reduce the scope of this White Paper ?
Some conclusions from the previous communications are , firstly , that there are substantial differences between the average penalties applied – as a number of Members have made clear tonight – and that the amount of penalties remains too low to represent an effective deterrent against non-compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy .
The Presidency has no knowledge of this request .
And what will be the result of all this ?
.
The honourable Member is entirely right to say that the issue we are discussing is of considerable concern to many groups in Ukraine , and many of the environmental NGOs which have begun to be active .
11 September reminded us that the breakdown of security is also a global phenomenon .
Madam President , the Commission proposal on the fixing of premiums and quotas for tobacco over the next three years centres around two main issues .
That is why last week we adopted two new proposals to strengthen passengers &apos; rights .
Much to my regret , therefore , I do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time .
Today , the same situation is being played out once again .
These amendments were tabled by other groups at first reading : Amendment No 5 , in particular , came from the Socialist Group .
The proposals regarding VAT are not bold enough .
In the <unk> we have worked very hard to improve the technical requirements and the definitions of the risk assessment .
It would certainly be a strategic error if the European Union were to be <unk> in the dilemma between Europe and Russia .
This has to be reconciled with effective action to combat illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings .
( DA ) The Amsterdam Treaty consists of a series of small steps and some great <unk> in the direction of <unk> <unk> .
.
It is expected - at least the Commission hopes so - that the implementation proposals will be presented to the Council very shortly .
In other words , it must be possible to implement at local level without the European Union having to regulate everything .
The conflicts between Taliban troops and the Northern Alliance continue , despite the long-standing military deadlock .
I believe that Mr Mombaur or Mr <unk> will be tabling an oral amendment tomorrow .
The forthcoming constitutional debate must lead to simplification , distribution of powers and increased democracy .
The results of these efforts have provided the basis for the action taken against individual officials .
That question of extending our already existing agreements with ASEAN to a new entry into ASEAN and the question of human rights , gives me the opportunity of reaching to the wider question of ASEAN itself .
And it is in this very sector that most Europeans earn their living .
We can also draw on the experience gained from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and other such programmes .
– the fact that the Commission is to conduct a ‘ strategic information and education campaign ’ to prepare consumers for the introduction of the euro in the new Member States ; Secondly , the social clause in Part III , which obliges the EU to meet the social objectives in all the areas of competence .
In tackling these issues from a perspective other than that of this broad spectrum of views , I am amazed that there are no rights to good governance and democratic elections .
The WTO should also take into account the precautionary principle , and &quot; the polluter pays &apos; principle .
Nevertheless , given that the financial perspectives negotiations are still ongoing , this would and will affect the Commission ’ s position on the <unk> of the programme .
An optimal framework of control must be created in order to make possible a biotechnological sphere which is aware of its responsibilities .
I voted for the joint resolution although there has not yet been ratification of the Nice Treaty in Ireland .
That is why , ladies and gentlemen , I would today ask you to vote in such a way as to reaffirm last November &apos; s vote and to adopt the report in the form presented to you by the committee .
As such , I only hope that the EU negotiators stamp their authority on the discussions , thus immediately <unk> the WTO &apos; s fundamental right of existence as an international organisation now and in the future .
Why does the Commission say nothing about this ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I support this report on the Prestige .
Even the case of a Member of the European Parliament who is facing criminal charges for <unk> with the Mafia has been met with silence in the media .
In conclusion , as I said earlier , this report has struck a balance by permitting comparative advertising in principle , provided a number of strict requirements are met so that there is never any question of harming the rights of competitors named in the <unk> .
Many speakers mentioned the special Luxembourg summit which is to focus on employment .
On the issue of public services I supported Amendment No 82 , which calls for public services to be exempted from the rules of Community competition law .
Mr President , I am reassured by the Prime Minister ’ s determination to focus on the Balkans and advance their progress towards the EU .
The fact that the talks on accession will not lead to changing the legal framework does not <unk> the importance of the issue .
Madam President , can I thank the Commissioner but just <unk> one small point in his presentation ?
That is another concrete possibility .
In my view , Poland is an example of what the new countries should and will have to do so that those countries that remain outside Europe ’ s new borders will not feel excluded , as Mrs Napoletano has said .
It is an integral part of all Euro-Mediterranean association agreements , including the interim agreement with Israel .
A question mark is therefore now hanging over the skills and expertise we have acquired , which are extremely valuable at a time when new space powers are emerging all over the world , at a time when we can see that the market studies carried out in the 1990s are no longer being acted on , in particular in the field of satellite <unk> .
Mr President , I could tell my good friend , Mr Pronk , that if he will have a word with Mr Aznar , I will have a word with Mr Blair .
I wish your delegation and our EU delegation to <unk> 10 in Buenos Aires all the best .
We would like to have a common fisheries policy that also believes in the future of the fishing industry .
With regard to the issue of the impact assessment - and I will end here , Mr President - we have commissioned an impact study with regard to third countries .
In fact monitoring is a fundamental instrument for checking whether the programmes the Community implements are effective in contributing to raising the protection of human health to a high level , guiding efforts to prevent disease , encouraging cooperation between the States , supporting their actions in this field and promoting coordination of policies .
This means that these manufacturers could just as easily use other materials .
The next item is the Commission communication on the screening of the legislative proposals pending before the <unk> .
<unk> , the social NGOs have been told by the Commission that they will need to be funded through our new discrimination and social exclusion budget lines .
I wish to assure you that we wish to cooperate with The Hague in the future in line with the commitments made , the adopted international instruments and our national laws .
The year 2000 was a year of hope .
According to the Commission , the political criteria have been met ; I do not believe that they have been in every respect .
<unk> , the same operation will have to be undertaken in future for revenues .
Indeed , Commissioner Monti stated that it has never been verified whether the ban on <unk> is observed when making purchases .
We would urge the Commission to continue with its negotiating efforts and ensure that there are going to be no further delays , so that Galileo , the largest of the <unk> industrial projects , moves forward under the best possible conditions and can play its appropriate role in the achievement of the Lisbon objectives .
Attempts are being made to find a solution , with further contacts scheduled in the course of this month .
A collective agreement on human rights is good .
No one can see into the future , but I know one thing : sharing this area of peace and democracy on which our Union is founded is a unique opportunity that we cannot allow to slip away .
Many technical experts have pointed out the difficulties encountered when inspecting the space between the two <unk> and during its maintenance .
What this means , then , is that , in terms of <unk> mobile telephony too , Europe will be lagging ever further behind , as the figures at <unk> testify .
I hope this is achieved in the future .
We also need to look at current legislation to see whether it is being implemented across each Member State .
Unfortunately , adjustments in the modern society that has emerged on the international scene in the twentieth century have caused <unk> to develop in various parts of the various continents ; it has not been possible to defuse these <unk> , because they are highly charged both politically and <unk> .
We have <unk> and <unk> on each other &apos; s shoulders for the last three years .
Most of us in this House , like Mrs <unk> who has just spoken , will be looking now in this grave crisis for the setting-up of something like a rapid alert system bringing together all the preventive measures which the European Union countries can carry out themselves .
Finally , I wish to say that I believe this report is important because anything that helps the countries to the south of us , in turn , helps us .
Before the previous agreement came to an end , I made contact with Morocco with a view to concluding a new fisheries agreement .
Unfortunately , we are up against it on virtually every score .
Thank you very much , Mr Hänsch .
The other reason has to do with comitology .
I have a follow-up question which I would like to have answered .
The concept of two separate subscription channels is therefore not a novel one for football <unk> in the UK .
It is up to the Iranian government to improve the situation .
<unk> , the means to achieve the ambitions that are being proclaimed are lacking .
In the present situation , the time for finding negotiated solutions is running out .
This patent is no isolated case , however .
<unk> I have met with finance ministers I have constantly repeated my request that they be ratified , but the speed is determined by the <unk> .
Mr Poettering has the floor first .
I am convinced that it will serve as an inspiration to your courageous husbands , just as the interest of the free world was an inspiration for me during the darkest times of my imprisonment .
.
We hope that some more light will be shed as to why a number of sectors are excluded .
Ukraine is a separate state and a separate nation , and I should ask you to bear this in mind .
We may perhaps not agree on all the individual points in this policy , but it has been <unk> out and can therefore serve as a guide to both the Council and the Commission .
From a more general point of view , I find it worrying that the European Union is implementing a policy that massively restricts the influx of immigrants , and that gives the impression of a fortress - as we already said yesterday in a similar debate - behind the measures that are adopted .
As far as the institutions are concerned , the report calls for Parliament &apos;s monitoring and codecision roles to be reinforced in all areas of EMU .
I am very glad that the rapporteur pays attention in his report to the opportunities for nationals of countries applying for membership to be included in the recommendations on mobility .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
What we have done is to apply pressure by announcing a total untying with regard to all essential drugs used to treat these <unk> diseases .
Apart from the health problems , we have to take into account the problems of <unk> .
Mr President , I hope that , at this late stage , we will not be taking up too much time .
The industry would still be subject to monitoring , reporting and verification requirements .
If we are to ensure that railways have a future outside of <unk> services , particularly in freight , then we have to take the actions that have been outlined to us by our rapporteurs .
After two and a half years of negotiations and five presidencies which have given close attention to the matter , agreement has been reached in the Council on Regulation No 1408 / <unk> , a particularly important regulation because it concerns the rights of workers in the European Union .
Firstly , there has been no decisive political thrust when we really needed it .
This service must therefore be kept public .
We must state clearly that these are our standards and our principles , and that they are <unk> .
Many of these fish are <unk> because they are of the wrong species , below the legal size and / or <unk> and are therefore killed before they have <unk> .
The United States of America has the Echelon system that enables it to <unk> every form of international communication .
I would point out to the Commission and the Member States the need for a reform of international maritime law that deals with matters such as health and safety at work and the requirements of contemporary maritime transport .
The truth is that we have grown apart .
It is as if it had given the Commission a bullet , but that bullet is on a cord , so that after each shot , the Commission has to return it to the Council .
I warmly welcome the fact that the Council intends to pay <unk> VAT out of the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) .
This amounts to saying that the Commission will include under the new Objective 2 all the regions that the Member States undertake to include in the list of assisted regions , which they must notify the Commission of under Article 92 ( 3 ) ( c ) .
In this case , these classified areas will not get any Community funding .
This of course includes the need to take into consideration both the special features of these areas and the objectives of the <unk> Regulations .
And the proof of this is the introduction of new policies for the environment , consumers , public health and - especially - social protection .
If we want to optimise quality assurance then this is the second step , now that we have already taken the first step , together with the Commission , of putting in place stricter product safety standards .
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers ( see Annex ) .
How do matters stand at present , however ?
This aid helped producers to offset the additional costs of transporting their products to mainland Europe .
As rapporteur , however , I have the duty to alert everyone to the fact that action to incorporate equality involves the danger of <unk> all at the same level , whereas equality promotes diversity and <unk> the notion of solidarity in diversity .
It is crucial that the <unk> people have their expectations of true election results fulfilled and the mission will do all it can to ensure that this happens .
We therefore urgently advise the parties to take an active role in the UN peace process , and have reiterated this in point 2 of the resolution in which we call for adherence to the 1994 Moscow Agreement on a cease-fire and separation of forces and the 1998 cease-fire protocol , as well as to the obligation to refrain from all use of force .
For journalists in Kinshasa and elsewhere , there is complete freedom of expression .
I am saying no to unilateral war .
We had the impression that the politicians were falling over themselves with radical demands and instructions , but none of them offered a particularly effective response to the outbreaks .
We are proposing several amendments to simplify the rule and make it a little more rational : there is no room for subsidiarity or for different national laws .
I hope that is the case .
This text , practically in the same words I have just used , is included in our synthesis report .
I want to put it on record that on Wednesday , <unk> Members of this House voted against scrapping Friday <unk> .
.
The joint debate is closed .
<unk> negotiations on enlargement began this week .
We must not sacrifice our convictions for the sake of economic or political considerations ; rather , we must use plain language when speaking with our Chinese partners .
We must go to Hong Kong with an ambitious and balanced proposal which civil society and all the member countries of the WTO can relate to and which will bring results they are satisfied with .
Even as parliamentarians , we were constantly <unk> upon and <unk> in Istanbul .
All this is happening against the background of enlargement .
We must strengthen the possibility of the European Parliament becoming the place of dialogue with the ECB , the place for transparent and regular exchanges - at closer intervals , in my opinion - the place where the President can express himself and where , on behalf of our people , we can question him without challenging its independence .
Questions to Mrs Diamantopoulou My services face huge problems collecting data from national governments .
The resolution that we tabled is a step in that direction .
This will probably cost us something , but surely we should be prepared to go ahead nevertheless if human rights are so important to us .
We need your input to determine the right targets and to secure the best results .
On the other , there is the feeling that paramilitary militias and fundamentalist <unk> have taken over the streets and taken the initiative in the territories under the control of the Palestinian National Authority .
However , the report on the Amsterdam Treaty is <unk> in some areas .
Mr Dell &apos;Alba has the floor on a point of order .
I agree with Mr van Velzen that it would be a lot more logical and realistic to speak about public information rather than documents .
We are defining the code numbers of a driving licence that is to be applicable Community-wide in future .
Firstly , this question has nothing to do with appropriations for the Structural Funds .
That means we need to press the point again in Vienna for an increase in the transparency and <unk> of the international financial system .
There is the <unk> phase of this Presidency , which is taking place at a pivotal and undoubtedly decisive moment , and then there is the longer-term phase , in which broader approaches will be outlined and in which the future of Europe will really take shape .
Much has been achieved .
The US emission standards for <unk> in 2003 are already stricter than what the Environment Ministers want within the framework of the directive on large <unk> in <unk> .
The focus should therefore be placed on the public institutions : <unk> should receive guarantees covering onerous contracts with the public authorities , so that they in turn can provide guarantees to <unk> .
We are also aware that it is not enough to declare that these are our priorities , that this is a time to take decisions : the first decision which Parliament and the European institutions are called upon to take concerns precisely the handing over of a large <unk> of sovereignty , and this decision requires sensitivity and determination .
There is willingness to do so on both sides ; what we need now is to see this in action .
Yesterday or the day before , the written procedure on the recommendation for 0.5 to be the maximum limit for alcohol in the blood was finally adopted by the Commission .
In all events , the debate is continuing on the timetable and for submitting proposals and I believe and hope that the European Union will table good proposals during the first conference of the parties .
This does not involve defence .
Hence , what is missing is a prevention policy which , as in <unk> , is the best way to combat such occurrences .
.
<unk> you , although I tried to follow his speech attentively yesterday , I may have missed something .
These decisions are usually taken without any consideration of alternative solutions for safeguarding jobs , and are sometimes taken by businesses making large profits , such as <unk> , or they may even come about as a result of mergers , which have just been authorised by the Commission , as in the case of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It is against this background that the Commission , even at this early stage of the Intergovernmental Conference , has made its contribution to that conference , making points that are very much in line with the recommendations of this report and of other resolutions adopted by the European Parliament : the preparation of our common action through this joint planning analysis capacity ; the question of the representation of the Union in foreign policy by the new model of troika , which is still under discussion ; the question of how we can change the decision-making procedures and whether some qualified majority could be introduced into the foreign policies , which is also still under discussion in the IGC ; the question of the defence component we discussed this morning in relation to the Tindemans report on the Common Security Policy ; last , but not least , a matter which is attracting some attention today , and <unk> so , the whole question of how we finance of the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
I would like to stress before the House that this is a solemn , important undertaking , which is not intended to put back enlargement , but to make enlargement possible in genuine , realistic , tangible terms .
In this connection we should recall that we have stressed everywhere that the humanitarian situation is also very serious in Gaza .
That is the cornerstone of our civilisation .
First , the principles of the pan-European transport policy , such as the social market economy and fair competition as <unk> principles of transport policy , but , Günther , and Commissioner Kinnock , we also need to review what progress we have made in implementing the results of <unk> and <unk> , because there is no point in constantly adopting more and more resolutions if nobody implements them .
Voting time will now be suspended and resumed after the formal sitting on the occasion of the visit of his <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Therefore , not only should we consider but in our opinion we absolutely must , Commissioner , ensure that the Commission appeals against these unfair conclusions of the <unk> Committee of the World Trade Organisation .
The discussion on the <unk> ?
It seems to me that the most relevant aspects and most significant requests in the motion for a resolution are : firstly , the definition of a European strategy for urban policy and the coordination of all Community policies concerning urban areas ; and secondly , the need for European support of European strategies on sustainable urban development .
As he says we are well <unk> with each other and I hope share mutual respect .
In addition , we accept the amendments aimed at highlighting the role of the various partners , <unk> training and <unk> , and those that clarify the Commission &apos;s powers so that it can implement and assess the European <unk> .
In 1998 that increased to 60 million tonnes , equivalent to 2 <unk> per day for a <unk> family .
<unk> the country &apos;s economy should also be a priority .
.
In this situation , every effort must be made to create the technical and legal basis on which the European Central Bank can best perform the tasks assigned to it in the Treaty .
While I firmly reject the use of violence as a means in our freedom struggle we certainly have the right to explore all other political options available to us .
First and foremost , development is and must be <unk> , because determining export priorities involves making a very dangerous choice - it highlights differences and tensions by encouraging the emergence of a <unk> of entrepreneurs who are focused on their profit alone , to the detriment of the people .
That is the reason for our political responsibility in the months ahead .
I do not intend to dwell on the detailed objections which have been raised , since some of them strike me as relatively <unk> ; the basic issue as I have explained it is , I think , a convincing argument for the adoption of Mrs Palacio &apos;s report .
It requires , in addition , <unk> data and design <unk> , namely on <unk> , physical and mechanical <unk> .
By providing a better understanding of consumers and markets , this Action Programme protects citizens from risks and threats beyond the control of individuals .
Those companies are already using these techniques in the market .
Mr President , I think that the debate taking place here shows the unanimous welcome this Parliament accords to the progress in the peace process noted in the <unk> <unk> ­ <unk> <unk> .
Finally , I should like to say a few words on public services .
I certainly welcome the fact that , today , we are finally debating these two reports : the Watson report and the Gebhardt report , although it is unfortunate that this should be a consequence of the tragic events of 11 September in the United States .
The European Parliament is fulfilling its responsibility for safeguarding European values and the accession criteria with this report .
The vote will take place on Thursday at <unk> a. m . If the objective is to start the intergovernmental process , we must move towards a political agreement on the contents of the reform between Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , all the <unk> of the European Union were pleased to see on the evening of 2 October 1997 that the Treaty of Amsterdam signed by the 15 Member States contained the first explicit references officially recognising the permanent and structural handicaps suffered by the island regions and the need to remedy this situation .
Lastly , we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries .
The Kyoto Protocol and the climate agreement also states that if a combined body of economic cooperation such as the EU cannot achieve the targets as a whole , responsibility for the targets set for it falls to all its Member States , in other words , if some Member States cannot meet their commitments , the Union will suffer as a whole .
In my opinion , however , we could also achieve adequate flood protection in Europe without a directive on the assessment and management of floods .
Today , Aceh is in a state of emergency .
What they were rejecting were both the form ( the superstate ) and the content ( the <unk> policies proposed ) , not to mention enlargement to include Turkey .
In that time , nothing has been easy , but the vast majority of <unk> – the vast majority , according to the figures – consider that the situation in the country is now better than it was two years ago .
The banning of overtime will deprive <unk> workers of additional earnings , and they will not be able to make ends meet with their basic pay alone .
So I maintain my request for a change of legal base .
It contained uniform law down to the last detail .
We cannot accept the withdrawal of one billion ECU in this <unk> way .
We will bring our proposals to the next meetings and we will take it from there .
A common framework of policies is needed if we are to avoid the risk of a trade war with the United States , with appeals to the WTO , and to curb the risk of divisions amongst ourselves across the European Union .
These friction costs can be attributed first and foremost to the absence of coherent system networks and connections linking the latter , leading to a loss of efficiency and an increase in transfer costs .
A new debate - and it will not be the last - is therefore being held in this House at an extremely important moment , because we are just a few months away from that enlarged , reunified Europe in which - and I say it again - the economic , social and territorial divisions and the inequalities will be even greater than at present .
What was once the <unk> concentration camp is situated on my home <unk> , which is also my electoral district .
In both cases it is perfectly justified to possess these holdings .
Lastly , Madam President , we want to see a reform of the Treaty so that Parliament , in relation to the third pillar , also has full access to justice by means of repeal in the event of regulations and acts which do not conform .
That is why every Member with eyes and ears has been able to read what the Presidency resolved in this matter .
I believe that we are indeed at a pivotal moment in Europe for determining whether we are going to have our own independent and proactive space policy , taking us further both in terms of technology and of scientific development .
If that is the case , then it would be worth looking into whether something can be done about this .
But , the fact that people can move freely across the borders involves risks , however , not least of which is that drugs can be moved across borders more easily .
There are two kinds of <unk> .
Could the Commissioner answer two questions .
I am proud that the Palestinian people <unk> me with this task .
We have voted in favour of this report ’ s proposal that the EU ( EC ) accede to this international convention .
I thank him for the progress we have made during this morning &apos;s debate , particularly over timing and the clarification of the position of the Council .
The allocations for structural policies and for internal policies break with the upwards trend that began in 1988 and that was reinforced in 1993 .
After all , banks have so far been obliged by the Member States to notify their central banks of any cross-border payments over EUR 12 500 , for the benefit of balance of payment reporting statistics .
Mr President , I have noticed with some degree of satisfaction that the <unk> action <unk> by some of the Members with a view to <unk> procedures has ground to a halt .
We consider this to be an alarming and unacceptable way of proceeding .
I could share with you many personal stories of Palestinian friends and their suffering living under violent Israeli occupation , but I want to share the story of a friend of mine in Israel .
You should have been informed of that .
It is certainly also right to accept safety standards in the form that applies during the checks and not as they apply when this directive is adopted , since I believe we will still have to tighten up some areas .
Only a very limited proportion of the energy supply comes from nuclear energy so this agreement should not be addressed to keeping open or improving nuclear power stations but to closing nuclear power stations and <unk> over to other forms of energy , just with the very reserves of oil and gas found in Kazakhstan .
A range of issues have been addressed , and I would just like to touch very briefly on one or two of them .
That is why the financial perspectives have offered us a greatly expanded budget .
It is actually a <unk> that more people have not been infected in Europe .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express the opposition of the Socialist Group in this House to Mr Costa ’ s amendment , and will say two things to justify that stance .
Voting on the reports will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon .
The Commission sees this debate as important support for its initiatives .
I believe that , for the vote on the 1998 budget , a certain number of conclusions should be drawn so that the budget is not <unk> by open credits which we now know perfectly well will not be spent .
Women &apos;s human rights is the <unk> area .
Human rights violations in the <unk> camps are hardly even mentioned .
That is a good start .
The two forest protection measures referred to by Mr Collins that we are now proposing to extend are the key elements in the conservation of Europe &apos;s forests .
The head of the mission and his team did an extremely professional job .
The issues of asylum , immigration , the criminal justice system and the balance between freedom and security require consensus on justice , and , more often than not , the harmonisation of legislation .
First of all there has to be an urgent public investigation : that is absolutely necessary .
We could , however , use these two reports as a basis for saying that there is , in fact , something that is very good in Europe .
I would also like to point out that this procedure is closely bound up with the operation of the internal market for energy and , as such , it must be a litmus test for the credibility of the system .
The Commission appears to have confirmed that it wants these guidelines to block , rather than facilitate , the application of those safeguard measures , as Commissioner <unk> <unk> made clear in the debate in this House .
<unk> Castro ’ s <unk> are hard to follow , both literally and <unk> , but also politically , <unk> and culturally speaking .
stands his ground .
This work cannot be undertaken in Pristina alone , both in view of infrastructure and political relations .
The latter need a <unk> call , to ensure the Pyrenees do not become <unk> .
Why do we simply talk and hold countless conferences , and it is not shut down ?
To what extent is it possible for you , from you office , to monitor and stimulate these issues ?
<unk> a few principles which we support , for example in the field of combating discrimination and xenophobia , the rapporteur actually includes an undertaking which is too partisan in the section on freedom , going so far as to place in the stocks the police , the legal systems and the media of some - only some , take note - Member States for events connected with street <unk> caused by the Black <unk> and their supporters in white <unk> .
Now it appears the <unk> on pipeline <unk> is poor and likely to result in major oil <unk> and pollution .
I should also like to thank Mr Leinen for enabling us to hold this debate on a very important issue .
The President of Parliament specially brought the debate and vote forward from the scheduled date in December to today &apos;s sitting .
The early warning systems , which consist of a complex network of satellites , <unk> <unk> and horizontal <unk> rely mainly upon the commercial electricity network .
We must get away from the tendency to focus increasingly upon details and instruments and instead concentrate on the results to which the European Council has attached importance since the Lisbon Summit .
I would say : shame on the governments of Austria , which is holding the EU Presidency , and Germany , for their <unk> , for their inability to discuss this matter with their own citizens .
The first is ensuring that human rights are not subject to double standards .
It must be seen in that context .

Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by expressing <unk> thanks to our rapporteur , Mr Manders , who has been right behind this directive in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and has endeavoured to unite the various views on the directive ’ s scope into compromises that all the groups can support .
It is at national level that coherence should be defined for land management , coastal management and maintaining a balance between the various types of fishing - inshore fishing , <unk> fishing , deep-sea fishing - and , moreover , the regions have no desire to take the place of the national authorities on this matter .
At the same time we have to recognize that the special employment summit is the beginning and not the end of the new process .
<unk> the former German Foreign Minister <unk> <unk> , we could say that European Union citizens will never be safe and happy if , beyond the borders of the Union , people live in economic deprivation and in the absence of rights and fundamental freedoms .
.
Mr President , I should like to start with a little <unk> which only your Irish colleagues can take the liberty of doing .
The objective was to catch up with the United States economically by 2010 .
The end result of this will be a political <unk> between the political groups in this House , while the Commission and the Council of Ministers get their directives through ; what I fear , quite simply , is that there is little prospect for qualified <unk> on the reciprocal amendments .
Until this is clarified by the Commission , I cannot support this ambiguous <unk> .
We have proof of that in the recent visit of the chairman of the <unk> , with whom we held a critical discussion .
The honourable Member will appreciate that it is for the Intergovernmental Conference alone to consider any possible amendment to the Treaty in this respect .
( Parliament adopted the resolution ) For these reasons , we were unable to vote for this report .
The question I am asking is a very important one , and one that also arose from a conference on democracy and human rights held in <unk> a few days ago , organised by , at which fifty countries from the Arab world released a statement that very clearly <unk> this .
.
– The purpose of the <unk> is not to serve the workers , but to make it easier for employers to compare job applicants and select those who , with the lowest demands , will <unk> &apos; fastest , whatever their country of origin .
<unk> , which is performed in many Union Member States , is a flagrant violation of this right .
That applies to industry , governments and consumers .
We are starting , , from a maximum ceiling for the budget within which we are trying to fit the policies , rather than looking at the policies and the funding they require and determining the extent to which the resources needed to finance them are available .
In particular , the draft regulation clarifies the nature of the certification to be provided by the Member State .
For obvious reasons , you are aware of the situation in Central Europe , and I had the opportunity to discuss it at length with Commissioner Solbes Mira ; there is a considerable need for investment and , in particular , budgetary pressure can only be reduced through a high volume of investment .
Stability at any price seems to have become the new political ideal .
That is in keeping with the Liberal view that a reduction in emission is too expensive at home and it is therefore preferable for this to be done in countries where this is more cost-effective .
Since I agree with the position set out by the rapporteur , I will make three very brief remarks .
There is no doubt that the European authorities are repeat offenders .
The fourth and last arrangements are the <unk> &apos; arrangements for the countries of the Andean Pact and the countries of Central America .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is my last address to a plenary .
If Mrs El <unk> is found guilty of <unk> , she will have to divorce , which is a violation of her private life .

In this fight , the Greek Communist Party expresses its solidarity , calling on the peoples to step up the fight against <unk> imperialism .
And if the European institutions have funds to give away , they should go to public services since , in all the countries of Europe , there is a shortage of health staff , teachers and public service personnel .

Indeed , this Parliament is the forum where the ECB must present its monetary decisions , justify them and , if necessary , let them be criticised .
Islam is of course blamed for all manner of deeds done by just a few Muslims .
I could not agree more about having a positive attitude towards liberalisation .
My report presents some considerable advances , which have the approval of a large number of Members .
The common position adopted by the Council responds to the concerns expressed by both legislative bodies , integrating the amendments proposed by Parliament with only two minor changes that leave their substance unchanged .
I also think that the current developments , not so much in Bosnia as in Belgrade , prove how important this element can be in strengthening democracy .
Are you from the Council ?
I am not going to go into all the details .
What procedural simplifications can EU citizens expect in this area in the foreseeable future , and what improvements will these bring about , in particular , with regard to the legal position of consumers ?
In that respect , the Commission also had to embark upon a study with a view to sending information to the European Parliament and to examining any proposals that would be worth presenting .
That is why I support and applaud the Pack report .
We need subsidies encouraging sustainable practices and efficient technologies .
In the present case , however , existing technical texts are being changed and here I can accept no amendments , because this would call into question all the texts and further complicate the already complex discussions .
I will end with a word about our working methods , by which I mean the relationship between your Parliament and the Commission in this field .
They are also banned from monitoring developments and carrying out inspections in the country .
We are told that <unk> million would be at risk if one were testing on 30 000 substances and the report goes up to 100 000 .
Nobody will contradict me if I say that we must once and for all and as quickly as possible put an end to 70 hour or more working weeks , 11 hour rest days , which may be reduced three times a week to 9 hours , and which are one of the main causes - if not the main cause - of heavy goods vehicle accidents on European roads .
Mrs <unk> came to see us , as a commitment had been made on the part of the European Union to provide the <unk> office with funds for one year only .
Mr President , I want to thank the Commissioner for using the word solidarity in connection with this report .
On banknotes , it has been agreed that the initial supply of banknotes for the euro area should be produced largely following a decentralised approach , that is each of the 11 participating national central banks will be able to organise the production of the euro banknotes needed to replace their national banknotes , either by producing the relevant banknotes themselves or by entering into bilateral <unk> arrangements .
Mr President , I have just come from the trialogue and Commissioner Liikanen is indeed tied up there as is the President-in-Office .
With those opening remarks , Mr President , I would commend our position to you .
I believe that some knowledge of past events , however summary , is important when forming an opinion on the present and on the outlook for the future .
As we know , Europe is making a significant economic effort in line with the Lisbon Strategy .
You cannot earn that confidence by sitting in secret in your office in <unk> ; you cannot earn it without <unk> information and without ensuring that citizens and our communities are informed about the way in which you do your work and the decisions that you take .
Finally , proof of origin of electricity generated from renewables will guarantee transparency for the public .
I am ashamed of our inability , over a year after enlargement , to motivate people between <unk> and <unk> and to persuade them that their sacrifices , their achievements and their <unk> over the last 15 years were anything other than futile .
Secondly , how might the proposal be <unk> in legal terms with a view to making it fit for adoption ?
However , it is important to act quickly because it is necessary to avoid another type of damage in addition to environmental damage : economic loss , which is detrimental to the interests of all <unk> <unk> , many of which have actually gone <unk> in the meantime .
From now on , chocolate is no longer a product which consists of nothing but cocoa butter .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , may I first of all congratulate Parliament on this debate .
Although I can , therefore , concur with the procedure proposed , I must point out that it is impossible to incorporate Amendment No 6 in the regulation in view of the legal implications for the Commission &apos;s powers of initiative .
Subject : <unk> prisoners of war in Iraq Although nine years have passed since the Iraqi occupation of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> men and 7 women who were <unk> remain in Iraqi prisons .
It sends us a constant stream of documents about the information society .
All Member States submitted their national action plans against poverty and social exclusion during June this year .
One <unk> and forward-looking feature of this report is the fact that it acknowledges the role not only of political decisions but also of civil society in creating an environment where human rights have the profound and enduring support of the people .
In six of the 12 candidate countries , unemployment exceeds 10 % , leading to social exclusion and poverty .
Although I do not at present see any need to alter the Stability and Growth Pact of 1997 , I nevertheless support the notion that any possible uncovered pension obligations in the Member States and current levels of taxation should also be taken into consideration when assessing payments made by euro countries in compliance with that agreement .
Commissioner , albeit somewhat <unk> , we are taking stricter and stricter measures .
Mr Tomlinson , it appears to me that there are two problems here .
Mrs van den Burg touched upon that issue .
<unk> have proved us right , for the fact is that unforeseen measures have made it necessary for this flexibility instrument to be <unk> to every year , so what I want to say is that the embarrassing situation in which we find ourselves as regards time and resources obliges us to agree to this compromise .
I would also like to particularly support Amendment No 3 from the Socialist Group .
Question Time ( Commission ) <unk> this is a <unk> exaggeration .
Another development has been the fact that some countries are now saying that they object to this .
Ladies and gentlemen , 2003 , the Year of People with <unk> , is almost upon us .
It is worth noting here that in the two countries which are most heavily indebted there is also an <unk> savings ratio and that debts are largely internally financed .
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions .
I am not of the opinion that these tests should be used solely for <unk> purposes , but in this regard as well we should base our decision , as indeed we have done , on scientific fact .
The European strategy requires precise laws and sure means of enforcing them .
The open method of coordination established between the Member States does not , I repeat , involve any legal commitment vis-à-vis the Member States .
Mr President , I suggest that we adopt the text as it stands and adjust it in line with the amendments that have already been adopted .
I therefore call on the Commission to take the initiative to introduce common <unk> levies in the EU , with the explicit proviso that the proceeds of such levies be passed back to the Member States .
I am fully supportive of this report as I believe the EU not only has an obligation to be as open and transparent as possible to its citizens ; it also has to take a leading role in setting an example to governments and parliaments of Member States as well as to those of accession and candidate countries .
The IGC was an ideal opportunity for the Dutch presidency to launch such talks , but it failed to take advantage of it .
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is using the corresponding Commission proposal to create a common legal framework for financing these two components of the common agricultural policy .
They include members and candidate members of the European Union , the countries of the Caucasus , the Balkans , Russia , Ukraine , Moldova and , generally speaking , countries with a particular political interest in the European Union .
Measures such as the European arrest warrant and the European <unk> <unk> will only be effective , however , when they are implemented by all Member States .
The <unk> of <unk> are putting up a good fight in defence of French , but the collapse of their <unk> , since the <unk> of what is known as the silent revolution , makes this battle in vain .
I hope that a broad majority in the House will support this report and that the Council and the Commission will take up as many as possible of the issues it raises , for we cannot sit <unk> by while the few rich people in Europe get even richer and the number of poor people rises .
There the connection is much more complex , because in certain cases the difficulty of <unk> the labour market is more connected with the specific characteristics of the welfare state and social security systems that benefit our own citizens .
If we believe in the United Nations , we must support it and we must strengthen it .
That is the important point .
<unk> Subject : European extradition arrangements The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a. m . This Directive on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions , insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial <unk> has been something that has been of immense interest to companies in the United States too .
On the basis of these developments , the Laeken European Council is expected to define the priorities and approaches that will guide efforts and cooperation at Community level .
This programme is not about the environment ; it is designed to make a public nuisance of itself .
It should really be a very prosperous place .
Fifthly , I demand of us ourselves that we use the funds we are left with for information and communication .
On the positive side , our environmental concerns have been broadly taken into account , since we now have a text that refers extensively to the Commission &apos;s responsibilities .
The discussion on the White Paper on transport policy is in full <unk> .
Since the publication of the Green Paper , the Commission has been concentrating on the capital market aspect and working towards the short-term aim of harmonising the <unk> rules governing pension providers under the heading of &quot; supplementary pensions in the internal market &quot; .
It is also a fact of life that geographically - apart from a few missing <unk> - Europe is turning into a huge entity with massive economic and political <unk> , the future of which is beginning to look interesting .
We voted on structural policy and on agricultural policy .

Why not encourage the other countries to <unk> these three countries which have already met the standard ?
Most people would be willing to accept these changes were it not for the fact that the only prospects they are being offered are ever increased <unk> and ever reduced social protection .
Moreover , right from the beginning of its mandate , this Commission has fought for renewed <unk> to be <unk> into the institutional debate in the Union .
What we need is a comprehensive strategy that must include the following elements : aid in the countries of origin , information campaigns via the mass media – including in the countries of origin – explaining the consequences of illegal immigration , and the establishment of a common external border protection mechanism using the visa information system , the Schengen information system and <unk> , so that we can achieve the objective of maintaining the stability and security of the European Union over the long term .
This gives us a chance to explain that this situation is not only a legacy of the former Portuguese colonial empire but an essentially European concern .
For these reasons I can support the principles expressed in the resolution .
Is it not rather ironic that it is precisely asylum and migration issues , which are at the very top of the political agenda in Europe , that have been echoed so clearly in this report ?
I would also like to insist , however , that one issue does not <unk> out the other .
That was the thrust of our amendment .
On democracy there can be no divisions among us .
The Bureau decided on a system in which it is apparent on three counts that an income is being paid as well as travel expenses .
This will offer an opportunity to give new impetus to the Barcelona process by means of adopting a peace and stability charter and by strengthening economic and cultural links between the two shores of the sea we share .

The second obstacle was removed because Ariel Sharon had the extraordinary courage to break with <unk> .
I want to apologise to Commissioner Patten because in my speech I gave him the title of Vice-President of the Commission .

The new government should present an EU integration programme for implementation on all pending issues .
It is evident that all the Member States continue to attach great importance to relations with the United States .
Madam President , &apos; Europe must do less to do better &apos; .
We must respond positively to these expectations .
Commissioner , you are now encouraging high expectations of gender budgeting , the implementation of which will mean the professional <unk> &apos; of every committee , every policy area , and every one of the Directorates-General .
Madam President , I should just like to say before I start that it is a bit rich of Mr Donnelly to say that people should not have a trade war .
The Committee on Budgets is also concerned about the <unk> of the budget process in the Environment Committee &apos;s Amendment No 8 .
In this context we must also recognise the realities of additional risk insurance , and thus also provide aid for resettlement and structural change .
We agree with the Commission that , in this second phase of opening up of the market , while full competition has not yet been achieved , it would be appropriate for there to be specific legislation governing the activities of telecommunications companies which used to have monopolies and whose economic and financial strength is such as to influence the market .
My impression is that Commissioner Fischler and his staff stood practically alone in this struggle , apart from one important but isolated speech by the President of the Commission .
This study was based on a particularly small <unk> of children who consumed sweeteners .
But equally , when we come to the vote on this report later , I will ask you quite explicitly at the end of the votes on the amendments , whether you can accept them .
So in parallel with the implementation of processes to promote literacy and education in general , we must also engage in some collective thinking about the living conditions of children in the various countries , especially in urban areas , and assist in projects to look after street children in third world countries , and also in our own countries , developing pilot schemes inspired , for example , by the family <unk> proposed by <unk> <unk> .
I am confident that Parliament will , as usual , play an important part in this debate .
Everyone knows that this is not the way <unk> behave .
I will have to limit my answer to reminding you that the Laeken Declaration will be more about the right questions and indications of directions , than about formulae and definite answers .
According to the provisional text of the new Maastricht II Treaty , the Commission will be obliged to give its views within six months .
This proves that , from the point of view of transparency , we have made some progress .
It is the lowest quality level which will be generalised in order to ultimately impose a standardised <unk> , to the detriment of taste quality .
The very serious problems raised in the report must be resolved at national level and through <unk> co-operation where this is considered necessary .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you and the German Government rightly declared that fighting unemployment was the central aim of the German Presidency .
Mr President , I would like to clarify paragraph 11 on which we are to vote .
Mr President of the Commission , we want to continue to give you our support , but we can only do so if your initiatives do not contradict each other and if the initiatives solve the problems rather than create new problems .
Therefore , in my report I suggest that we monitor the performance of the programme using specific parameters which will say how effective that programme has been and ensure that the Community funds are being <unk> and used effectively .
I am very pleased that has been emphasised and I thank <unk> Caudron very much for his work as well as , of course , Commissioner Busquin .
This causes problems especially for small and medium-sized enterprises .
However , development of rail transport within Ireland is vital to reduce road traffic and internal air traffic and consequent fuel use .
A recent study by the development organisation <unk> shows that EU agricultural subsidies in Great Britain mainly benefit large <unk> .
The issue raised by the honourable Member is undoubtedly of considerable importance , not only to the individual named in her question but also in so far as it is likely to have a direct impact on other citizens of the Union in a similar position .
It appears that they are doing so to raise funds with which to finance their guerrilla activities .
Independent human rights organisations can scarcely operate in the country .
I should like to start with the report prepared by Mr <unk> .
I grant you that .
What readmission agreements were concluded ?
They reinforce the political strength of the <unk> which is most certainly not our intention .

As one possible candidate for President of Chechnya said to me , money creates peace .
All of this requires a <unk> approach , hence the need for dialogue between our three institutions : Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
I said that a long process was ending today , and it is appropriate to underline , on behalf of my group and speaking personally , Mr Medina Ortega &apos;s excellent management , which we have witnessed on other occasions , but which assumed particular importance during this extremely complex and delicate conciliation procedure .
Before answering your questions , I would like to stress that this report does not offer any firm or definitive guidelines .
We have presented proposals on government contracts , postal services and enterprise policy .
That is democracy , thank you .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office , the Spanish Presidency has done a good job so far , but the Seville Summit will be the deciding factor in our final judgment of it .

The Commission ’ s latest progress reports confirm that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria , in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law .
For them to take to the streets , as they did at the Labour Party Conference in <unk> last week , or blockade a port to stop pigmeat being brought into the UK , as they did in <unk> in my constituency a few weeks ago , things have to be desperate indeed .
A nice lesson from which a sector in crisis will not be slow to draw conclusions .

Mr Pirker &apos;s office was kind enough to inform you , but it was not kind enough to inform us as well .
Faced with such environmental disasters , which do not all have natural causes , as we well know , in the face of their human consequences - in Portugal , eighteen people lost their lives in these fires - faced with their economic consequences - hundreds of thousands of hectares have been destroyed and , as a result , thousands of farmers are out of work in central Portugal , the country &apos;s poorest region - faced with these thousands of people who can no longer work unless we find jobs for them straightaway and who will be tempted to migrate towards the towns or to the coast , we must take action on all fronts and at all levels .
However – once again I will be frank , because I am in the habit of saying what I think and see – for the 1994-1999 period , in other words the first period , the closure operations are progressing slowly , too slowly , and we are faced with an excess of appropriations .

If there are no specific family rights as such - as the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights decided , very much against my wishes - then such rights do not exist for the other <unk> or same-sex communities either and the section on &quot; <unk> and types of relationship &quot; has no place in this report .
An example of this is where a crime is linked to a cultural or religious <unk> .

The Union and Member States should launch a major information campaign to make citizens aware of the environmental advantages of <unk> petrol .

We are therefore stressing the need to reduce socio-economic obstacles to mobility , so that these Community programmes , instead of being addressed solely to a specific elite , which is unfortunately what is happening today - will be genuinely available also , and especially , to the less well-off and to those who have not yet been through higher education .
I can , however , assure Mr Kaklamanis that the Commission will take care to ensure that if the special provisions of the agreement to which he refers are invoked , we shall see to it that it is fully justified and that in any event it will have as little effect as possible on Community interests .

It is about nothing less - and this is , or would be Parliament &apos; s task - than making European unification public property .
Along with making markets more flexible , properly mentioned by the rapporteur , given that current progress means that the same goods can be produced with far smaller <unk> , instead of promoting unnecessary creation of jobs , swimming against the <unk> , we must anticipate the new preferences of our citizens - this could be an important role for the Commission to play - in the sectors of culture and the use of <unk> , for example .
As every speaker has already said , many mistakes were made , but I do not think it right to table a motion of censure at this stage .
To conclude , Mr President , I welcome the fact that , as regards this issue , which , as we can see , is complex and sensitive , the European law that we are in the process of drawing up in this House establishes first and foremost general principles and rules , which must be flexible and progressive in the interests of putting patients first .
Report ( <unk> / 2000 ) by Mrs <unk> , on behalf of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , on the communication from the Commission to the Council , the European Parliament , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions : Community support plan to combat doping in sport ( COM ( 1999 ) <unk> - <unk> / 2000 - 2000 / <unk> ( COS ) ) The Swedish programme talks enthusiastically about competitiveness , competition and free trade .

We support , too , the reduction in the number of objectives from seven to three and we believe it is necessary to make State aid , as established by Article 92 ( 3 ) ( c ) of the Treaty , compatible with the Structural Funds , especially in Objective 2 regions where the two types of aid need to be compatible .
I believe that would represent a very significant modernisation in view of the many concerns you have expressed today .
What is apparent to me from the <unk> crisis in my own region , and the role that <unk> has played in this , is that the women ’ s network has contributed towards a solution , and I have to conclude quite simply that it is very much to be welcomed that the fisheries sector is being <unk> socially speaking .
That being said , the new treaty fails to provide for the functioning of an enlarged Union .
The Maastricht criteria have forced governments to <unk> their budgets .
For <unk> &apos; shows that we have a multiplicity of languages and do not express ourselves in only one language , the so-called <unk> <unk> , English .
It is time that we <unk> out the way it should be .
