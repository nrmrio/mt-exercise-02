As we do not support patents in general , not just those on information technology , we voted against the proposal contained in the McCarthy report .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
These reports have since been a major factor in the preparatory debates on these issues .
President <unk> assured me this week that an agreement with the IMF is now on the cards and I think the relevant meeting in Washington is at the beginning of December .
The lack of an EU regulatory framework for <unk> and differing national rules have created uncertainty for companies , barriers to trade within the internal market , greater administrative burdens and costs , and a weakening of the EU ’ s position in international trade negotiations .
No , Mr President , as an addition I continue to think that they go together very well , and that it strengthens our hand in respect of the Commission and the Council during the second reading .
In these consultations with our partners and all those involved in the IGC , including of course the European Parliament , we are seeking to build a complete picture of the situation in the IGC .
But it does not .
This applies to thousands of support businesses and workers ’ families in <unk> and neighbouring areas , as well as to the General <unk> workers themselves .
Consequently , the situation <unk> administrative inefficiency , with the Commission and the Member States as the guilty parties .
Does the operator really save inspection costs ?
Furthermore , it was precisely for this reason , and also because I am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action , that I spoke today to Commissioner Nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
I hope the Commission will take this matter up with the utmost seriousness .
Like Mr Haarder , I too believe that we owe them a debt of gratitude .
That applies in particular to the question of minimum safety distances .
We are all attached to fundamental rights and the rule of law , starting here in this House .
<unk> and <unk> are very important for the future of the economy and society .
<unk> raw ingredients from the farm <unk> are the basis of <unk> safe food .
Lastly , several Member States are already legislating in this area and , without this directive , we could see a genuine fragmentation of the internal market .
When the means of distributing the most basic , simple wealth changes , the entire economy changes as well .
You tell us that there is such a thing as interregional solidarity .
It is an economy which is currently more than 40 % dependent on agriculture , a country which in twelve years time wants to see a free trade zone achieved with Europe .
This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful , as shown by the US precedent .
We therefore request that the Council and the Commission publish a report annually , or every two years , on human rights in the countries participating in the Barcelona Process , which could be used as a basis for the implementation of cooperative operations between the European Union and third countries .
Progress in achieving the targets set for the reduction of budgetary deficits is reviewed twice a year , so that it is possible to lift a suspension of aid within the year .
I strongly urge Members to support both the amendments in the vote today .
If we brought this down to 100 % , we would free the world market from <unk> sugar and milk powder and we would at the same time offer our farmers a better price .
The Commission has attempted to set out the arrangements for genetically modified maize and soya in its draft Regulation .
I should like to restate what I said in October 2004 on this matter .
We do not even have precise knowledge concerning the situation in Laos , as foreign human rights organisations are not allowed into the country .
That is why it is quite essential for the groups listed in Article 13 to be effectively protected against discrimination .
Both are candidates on the list of the Socialist Party of Serbia for the elections on 28 December .
I would , however , like to say that calls for proposals are still applicable in the so-called Category 8 , which brings together support for policies with emerging policies .
If we impose the <unk> of an exclusively <unk> regime too rapidly , bananas are going to taste incredibly <unk> to thousands of small African producers .
The world is beginning to divide in a new way .
<unk> disputes about trade policy must be resolved through mutually acceptable solutions but they must not overshadow the many common political interests and the rich dialogue we have with the United States .
That puts at risk the lives and livelihoods of those people who are the most vulnerable - the people who are working there .
Is it not the case that there should be at least as much consideration given to the safety of people in the latter environment , particularly since , in the time since the 1999 directive came in we know a great deal more about the possible harmful effects of <unk> and <unk> radiation on young people ?
That would however be offset by the fact that EU revenue - which is based after all on national currencies - would fluctuate in exactly the same way .
This is something I would have liked to have seen fought out before the Court of Justice .
Europe is blocking production and the only beneficiaries are the United States and Australia .
There are enough tasks to get to grips with .
<unk> recommendations ( <unk> and <unk> / 2000 ) Are you aware that the <unk> Civil does not reveal the identity of some of those arrested for meat meal fraud ?
In fact it has been nothing more than a private meeting of Parliament &apos;s Bureau .
I would ask you to stand by the original , namely ‘ <unk> characteristics of Chechen society ’ .
There is room for all professions concerned with the law and the administration of justice - such as lawyers , public prosecutors and police officers in the United Kingdom - to play their appropriate parts .
Noise in all its forms may well be a scourge in our town centres , around our airports , on our roads , yet surely we should put road safety first .
That is why it is important that Turkey is included in the European Conference .
It is in this context , in which history and civilisation , cultural processes and the drafting of laws , the <unk> of the present and a necessary view of the future all merge , that the importance of the proposal that every citizen of the European Union should learn foreign languages is most clearly seen .
My request is that we should all be more ‘ <unk> ’ when it comes to fighting crime .
It is about the ethics of communication .
Mr President , in principle , I am all in favour of decentralisation .
I trust the Commission took careful note of events in the House this morning during the vote on the budget .
In this context , considering the importance of RFOs for the future of the common fisheries policy and the different levels of organisation , competences and development of each organisation , the Community needs to adapt its participation according to their respective characteristics and to harmonise its role within the 30 existing RFOs , in order to speed up <unk> of the recommendations adopted by the RFOs into Community law .
It is regrettable that the Member States have not yet been able to agree on a Members ’ Statute and it is hoped that progress will be made on this during the course of 2004 .
That is the first point which I wished to make here .
The second category of decisions that would cause us concern if they were to be decided by qualified majority voting relates to immigration and the international movement of persons , which , under Article 67 of the EC Treaty , require unanimity for at least five years after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam but can then be decided by a majority .
In the longer term we must change the EU &apos;s agricultural policy so that we can put an end to artificial excess prices and surplus stocks .
As mentioned by Mrs Wallström in her speech , the Commission has a reform plan to assist our efforts .
It should be in its rightful place .
I do not think it is necessary for us to agree upon woolly compromises a few weeks before we have the directives in front of us .
Subject : <unk> for Swedish adoption of the common currency The introduction of the euro at the beginning of the year has lent urgency to the debate in Sweden on its possible future adoption of the common currency , the timing of which is one of the principal issues .
I was therefore somewhat shocked to see that someone had placed a veal <unk> on the floor below , just when we were about to discuss the issue .
The Council has stated on several occasions that the fight against terrorism is a priority and the recent terrorist attack in <unk> highlighted once again the need for close international cooperation on the fight against terrorism .
The purpose of <unk> is to help organisations to perform better and to exceed that minimum .
The next item is the statements by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission on the Middle East .
Unfortunately , the <unk> review of the Lisbon Strategy and the proposal for the new financial perspectives undermine the importance of the social agenda and give less money to this priority , whereas we need to invest more in knowledge , research , innovation , training and in support for the weakest members of society : persons with disabilities , immigrants and vulnerable groups such as young people , the elderly , women , unskilled workers and the unemployed .
I look forward to further years of cooperation .
That is why some of us seek an Amendment No 56 to allow adjustments in this area on the advice of the Scientific <unk> Committee rather than requiring fresh legislation to implement them .
I believe that the key lies in greater investment in research and development .
Firstly , not one single <unk> will be lost .
Another , now <unk> , member of the <unk> is alleged to have been engaged in airline ticket fraud amounting to some EUR 11 000 .
In short , the Stability and Growth Pact has not proved to be a dynamic tool for implementing this strategy .
We are about to see another harsh blow dealt to fishing in the European Union .
We must look beyond this current unrest and the entirely unacceptable excesses that it has generated , and consider the absolutely essential issue that lies behind it , that is to say the heightened expressions of identities wounded by a profound sense of injustice , domination and humiliation , for which the West , from Palestine to Iraq in particular , is responsible .
But in Asia , even this eventuality seems unlikely , for if some prices have reduced - shares , for example - others have increased , such as imported goods .
I believe we should be reassured that the more active diplomatic measures taken by other countries , such as the United States and India , are appropriate .
We have no intention of tabling any amendments , therefore .
I need not repeat my strong conviction that the progress made so far , thanks to the political will of the Council and Parliament , needs to take concrete form as soon as possible through the adoption of the proposal for a regulation .
The second issue is terrorism .
Not to allow the <unk> to give legal advice <unk> in the face of reality .
Finally , I will transmit Mrs Read &apos;s request for a review of Member States &apos; applications for derogation to Commissioner Bangemann .
This will only apply to specialised industrial and institutional uses where the <unk> have been declared and taken into account in the risk assessment .
For the sake of uniformity of treatment , the Legal Affairs Committee is in favour of amending the Commission proposal ( Article 12 of the First <unk> Directive ) to give the relevant Member States the opportunity in future , in addition to the exchanges of information in which banking supervisory authorities may already engage with their counterparts in their own country , in other Member States and in third countries , to conclude cooperation agreements on the exchanging of information with <unk> supervisory authorities in third countries too .
Since the Treaty of Maastricht , tourism policy has been a central objective of the action of the European Union .
We await the Commission &apos; s multiannual planning next month .
The directive should also contain mechanisms to discourage , as we have already heard , the Member States from their market distorting subsidies to traditional forms of energy , particularly fossil fuels and nuclear .
Clearly urban areas promote economic growth and have high levels of supply of and access to public services , such as education , health and transport .
I think they have seriously improved on the Council &apos;s common position , which did too little to protect intellectual property .
Indeed , as Mr Roche said , nothing is agreed until the whole thing has been agreed .
There is clearly a legal problem .
The issue which was raised earlier about human rights atrocities is of very considerable concern to the international community .
SEC ( 1998 ) <unk> - <unk> / 1998 <unk> / <unk> ( <unk> ) As regards the other budget <unk> , although the Council has maintained the major allocations , for a limited number of budgetary lines it has not retained all the appropriations the Commission asked for in its preliminary draft budget .
I agree with the rapporteur that in this field it is preferable for the provisions concerned to be directly applicable in all Member States instead of being subjected to the uncertainties stemming from the transposition of a directive .
If we are to reach a compromise with the Americans , then surely the minor problem of the <unk> can be resolved as part of the overall package .
To end , I would remind the House that the current Spanish government was not in power at that time in 1992 .
Now it may well be that the time had not been properly worked out , and it is the case that a number of Members did not turn up , and that there were those – the Commission and the Council , for example – who spoke with unexpected <unk> .
I therefore voted in favour of the proposal , despite its containing a certain amount of woolly <unk> .
With regard to Parliament &apos;s administration , I fully support the measures for increasing awareness , information and vocational training , and on <unk> the needs of professional and private life , specifically through flexible working hours and making <unk> infrastructures available .
They show an accumulation of fraud and inertia , without really explaining where this paralysis comes from .
Since the beginning of the humanitarian emergency in the early 1990s , we have been a major donor , delivering some EUR <unk> million in assistance since 1995 .
I also believe that , in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity – of which you , in fact , wholeheartedly approve – the only thing we should ask of the Commission is that it create a legal framework for public services .
In Pakistan , for example , Islamic laws are regularly misused in order to settle personal <unk> .
At the time of the events , Commissioner Frattini was Minister for Foreign Affairs , so either he did not know , as he told the committee , or he was unaware of the agreements ...
It is becoming a determining factor in the <unk> and <unk> world in which we live , in which the capacity to perceive one &apos; s own identity is a prerequisite to peaceful coexistence with other identities .
In many Member States a lot of work still needs to be done to give female entrepreneurs more opportunities and certainly in order to let wives work with their husbands under a proper legal status .
In our view this question should be resolved in a conciliation procedure , not under a trialogue , because that would demonstrate exactly how much importance we attach to this question and just how much store we set by Parliament &apos;s having full right of control .
<unk> and official welcome What has become of young people and , especially , women where this issue is concerned ?
Therefore , if we accept the modulation of CAP aid , that modulation must take place according to parameters that do not put paid to the competitiveness of farms and that take into account the economic inequalities of the European Union .
It merits our support .
It was decided that operational headquarters would be at <unk> ? ? ? ? .
We understand them and are in solidarity with them .
This means we are no longer in the pre-accession phase .
I do not believe that we should be producing European directives that can be interpreted in different ways .
Mr President , to repeat a <unk> expression used by <unk> ( the European Association of <unk> &apos; and <unk> &apos; Societies ) , the draft under discussion was subjected to unjustified attacks during its review by the Council .
Unless we have the opportunity which these amendments provide for action to be taken within the normal processes over a longer period of time , we run the risk that the manufacturers of products may escape liability without expensive legal proceedings intended once again to change the law .
That is the message of the report .
The European Council ’ s appeal for the EIB to enhance its R &#91; <unk> &#93; D efforts is , in this context , an innovative and pragmatic solution , if EUR 30 billion actually can be <unk> in this way .
The European Commission really does not like <unk> , or at least European <unk> .
After all , from time to time we do also express criticism of the Commission , even if it considers this to be unjustified .
At the same time , the Council <unk> to set up the European Agency for the Management of <unk> Cooperation at the External <unk> of the Member States of the European Union ( Regulation ( EC ) No .
2007 / 2004 ) .
I must remind Mrs Izquierdo Rojo of Security Council resolutions <unk> , <unk> and <unk> which she doubtless keeps under her <unk> if she feels that way about Libya .
I thank the President-in-Office for his very short and <unk> reply .
It will also reveal whether truth can prevail in this House , or if Parliament will simply become a breeding ground for lies .
The Commission is convinced too , and we are going to prepare that great framework programme , that great cultural programme , right away .
This is serious , as whilst it may be true that water is becoming ever more important in economic terms , it is also true that the right to water is a human and social right for everyone .
Mr President , cohesion policy has been at the heart of the European project from the outset and it is a policy dependent upon the concept of regions at the expense of nations .
At the same time , I am also aware that the exploitation of these species is currently regulated by the Commission for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , to which the Community is a party .
.
I gladly voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on development and sport tabled and supported by my colleague , Mrs Martens , as sport is one of those disciplines bringing people together and moving them forward along the road to greater wisdom and progress .
In this document entitled <unk> <unk> &apos; there are barely two paragraphs on subsidiarity .
When the distribution of incomes becomes increasingly uneven - which is unfortunately what is happening in Europe today - what we get is an automatic reduction in demand .
Although I hope that Mrs Smet ’ s optimism will prove to be justified , many people fear that the <unk> of 3 000 workers in <unk> is simply <unk> the factory &apos;s final closure and relocation .
Please allow me also to thank the representatives of the Council and the Commission for their exemplary assistance and their wish to find a consensus right from the outset , allowing a financial framework for European standardisation to be found at the first reading .
This means that cement kilns will for a time be subject to standards which are less strict .
These amendments will not enter into force until all the Member States have approved the amendments made to the Treaties in Amsterdam .
For the first time there has been awareness of the need to find European solutions to this type of issue related to maritime pollution .
The debate is closed .
I am absolutely open to looking into the matter , but it is dependent on whether we have received the relevant information .
US President <unk> <unk> approved the Cuban <unk> Act in 1966 .
Not a single one !
In this regard , I liked your term , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi : we must all pull together , preferably in the same direction .
I am glad that the United States has come round to this strategy of achieving something by way of negotiation .
As far as Amendment No 7 is concerned , I do not see what added value it gives .
The European Parliament is now faced with a new situation and has to decide how to react ; how it can make a more helpful contribution to peace .
The debt of countries affected by the tsunami clearly needs an urgent response .
We are working on this , and so , in particular , is the Commission .
And I believe that your programme guarantees a social , sustainable and politically stronger Europe .
Does the Commission have instruments to limit the transfer of sugar quotas between countries , for example from Poland to other countries ?
<unk> , however , entail enormous costs to the environment , such as the contamination of groundwater and the loss of biodiversity and costs to human health , such as endocrine disruption , <unk> and cancer .
The report tackles some of the institutional problems that exist in the Union , above all from a democratic perspective .
These then are the tasks which must be placed at the very top of the Union &apos;s agenda , not least because we owe it to our own citizens and those of third countries to do so .
The second point on which we disagree is the budget , on which Parliament has already made numerous efforts to reach a compromise with the Council .
At the same summit where this agreement was not signed , Russia was still accepted as a market economy .
It also contains many demands and proposals .
In addition , the report insists on the need to maintain parliamentary control of the financing of the CFSP , and it is a well known fact that not all of the Member States agree with that .
Otherwise , I can see Parliament pursuing a constant debate on constructive dialogue which achieves nothing , as we saw before in our critical dialogue with Iran .
There are those who have not been persuaded by the debate , such as Mr Wurtz , who said in his statement that he welcomed the constructive spirit and added : &quot; we have five years to succeed &quot; .
Over and above the excellent communication from the Commission he makes a number of interesting suggestions for reinforcing the European Union &apos;s external policy on human rights .
A lasting solution to this problem therefore depends on the <unk> of civilian life by means of the restoration of democratic mechanisms and structures in the Chechen Republic .
Mr Baker submitted a proposal on 16 January 2003 for a political solution to the conflict which guarantees self-determination in accordance with Security Council Resolution No <unk> of 30 July 2002 .
Mrs Sandbæk , we have a problem here .
The threat biological weapons pose requires an appropriate multilateral response .
At the moment , we spend our time at summits <unk> decisions instead of complying and pushing ahead with what has been agreed .
As a result , it will be possible to ask all the questions that I can currently read in the faces of those around me then .
Through these rules , biotechnology is being given justified opportunities , without the public health risks being underestimated .
Another area where we agree is the need for open and transparent consultations .
I shall begin with the <unk> : company closures , brutal and inhumane <unk> , mass redundancies , sudden relocations ; these are the unexpected and , I hope , <unk> aspect of Europe &apos;s somewhat <unk> capitalism .
This would send out a signal of enormous importance in terms of the future dynamics of the reform process as well as those of the accession negotiations .
In the light of the requirements and of what the alternative might be – that is to say , a policy in which the main responsibility for gathering information were imposed on the chemicals authority , I must , in spite of everything , take a positive view of the compromise .
After all , the <unk> of illegal immigrants may not be kept ten but two years , may not be compared with each other - one <unk> why - and may only be used for comparison with new asylum applications within the two-year period .
These included economic and monetary union , employment , the intergovernmental conference , internal security and the management of the Union &apos;s external relations portfolio .
These same ministers were incapable of making specific commitments in <unk> .
Here too , advances must be made for until these two points are resolved , it will not be possible to <unk> the SFOR <unk> either .
I think it is worth pointing out that the closure of each negotiation will depend on the progress to be made by the countries concerned and nothing that the Commission proposes today signifies the rejection of certain <unk> .
What is more , it is right that a reciprocal exchange of data throughout the European Community should be initiated as soon as possible .
First , monitoring at ports of call .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great honour and also a little <unk> to speak before the <unk> of my delegation , Mrs <unk> , whom I would have preferred to follow .
For this reason I am going to vote for Amendments Nos 11 and 12 .
However , there are three core principles which have to be adhered to if flexibility is to work .
Generally speaking , we want to get away from actions that grab headlines but are no more than short-term and temporary , in favour of long-term measures that , by addressing the problem at its source , protect health more effectively .
Mrs <unk> &apos;s question refers to one of the possible results of the accession talks with Poland , but these have not even begun yet and at this stage the Council has not yet taken any operational decisions on them .
It certainly indicates the importance which Parliament attaches to the matter of pension funds and also to the issue of problems in the area of taxation .
I do not think that the Council has been able to justify its decision , in terms of the possible partnership between operators in third countries and from within the Community .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I can hardly believe it : the House is almost , if not entirely unanimous .
This excellent analysis shows that the excessive concentration of powers and the bureaucratic <unk> which this creates represent a very significant source of fraud and corruption .
That has also become clear in this debate .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my first speech to this House as a member of the European Commission five years ago was , of course , about the 2000 Budget .
So , the euro has arrived .
Firstly , it seems to me , in the light of the Bureau &apos;s interpretation of these actions , that it is clear that the President in the Chair at the time acted incorrectly in interpreting the Rules , because what should have happened for a gross breach of conduct was that the Member should have been excluded from the House at that moment .
That is it as far as the first directive is concerned .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , representatives of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we welcome the Commission communication on the new financial perspective as an interesting debating exercise for the future .
I am also once more concerned to ensure that the multiannual management plans should cover not just the fluctuations in stocks but also the social impacts , in keeping with the promised consistency with other Community policies .
The budget for institutions other than the Commission and the Council for the year 2000 will be EUR <unk> billion .
Have we produced consultation documents when we should have produced initiatives , because it was the easy option ?
For me , however , Member <unk> legal jurisdiction over the TV companies , like the rights of the consumers , and - not least - those of children , are equally important in requiring clarification .
We need to respond with action , with investment , we need to re-establish confidence , we need to take our entrepreneurs , investors and companies there .
Apart from that , the Court of Justice has yet to take its final decision in this respect on the <unk> case , which is all the more reason for leaving any discussion of this matter until we debate the Lulling report .
That is not the citizens &apos; Europe !
A reduction of 2 <unk> is technically possible without jeopardising safety .
In 2006 Parliament decided to invest in three major information projects , which included the building of a new visitors ’ centre , audiovisual facilities and web television .
Despite the extraordinary and unique efforts of the European Union , which provides approximately half of all public aid to developing countries , the fact remains that in <unk> Africa and southern Asia , over 40 % of the population are still living below the poverty line , and world-wide , 800 million people , 200 million of them children , are suffering from <unk> malnutrition .
The draft Charter of Fundamental Rights within the European Union is a vague compromise between these two conflicting views , with the second taking precedence over the first .
In particular , it should state categorically that consumption of poultry meat does not represent a health risk .
Of course we do not wish to question the merit of the rapporteur &apos;s initiative , and I wish to congratulate him .
That afternoon , the time available for speaking to the reports amounts to 50 minutes each for the Council and the Commission , while Mr Brok , the rapporteur , gets five – which is quite utterly inadequate in view of the importance of his report – and all the Members put together get 90 minutes between them .
And can you guarantee us personally , that you are going to ensure that the questions that myself and other colleagues wanted to ask you today about the work of this group and the appointment of a new chairman are going to be answered quickly and correctly , in an open and transparent way ?
The European Union must take a firm stance .
We need that to be put into effect relatively quickly .
That too is a most laudable achievement on the part of Greek economic policy .
Furthermore , the imposition of fiscal <unk> is wrong at this particular time .
Secondly , on the Kurdish question there was , albeit in unfortunate circumstances given the death sentence on <unk> , still the first step towards a political solution .
Mr President , I would not only like to thank the Commissioner for being here , but I would also like to say to all my colleagues that I think it is usual for a Parliament which respects itself to make an initial political evaluation a week after Kyoto took place .
With regard to compulsory expenditure , full agreement was found between both branches of the budgetary authority .
The issues and debates we face are increasingly complex and politicians will soon have to be <unk> and <unk> scientific experts as well , if they want to understand and not accept the word of experts as <unk> .
We shall look at that when we come to the vote on the report .
For this reason I think it is very right that Mrs <unk> has emphasized in her report that the new media have had the benefit of community funding within the framework of initiatives for the encouragement of the information society , whereas the written press has received no such support .
That was in North Aceh .
I therefore believe - and here I am addressing the Commissioner , Mr Flynn , as I know that he is sensitive to these issues - that the European Union should play a truly active role in the social economy as a whole .
We must do this together , in a spirit of good will and cooperation .
As it is important that an acceptable compromise be reached with the Council , it is unfortunate that Parliament should have chosen in this way to put an <unk> power struggle into the mix .
.
We have done this not out of some sort of opposition to an open and truly functioning European internal market – quite the contrary , in fact , for it is one of the most important conditions for the European Union to grow together .
<unk> of the EDF in the budget would benefit the ACP countries ; it would boost the political effectiveness of EU aid and help make the administration of the aid more efficient .
That was until the profession finalised a programme permitting an 80 % reduction in these <unk> catches through the implementation of sound <unk> and the systematic presence of observers on board the boats .
The strongest opponents are the Greek Cypriots , who are the European people that has most recently been at war with Turkey and the northern part of whose country is still occupied by Turkey .
It will then be much easier for European Union citizens , in future , to be able to settle claims abroad , including in EU Member States , with their own insurers , safe in the knowledge that these agreements are also then guaranteed by the Commission within the framework of the exemption regulation .
It happens very quickly .
.
At the moment we are negotiating a similar programme with the Moroccan Government , and a decision will be reached before the end of the year .
It is examining areas where <unk> alternatives could be introduced .
In case measures should be taken against persons or companies from the Community , it has reserved the unlimited right to take the case up again within the framework of the WTO .
Just what is the so-called international community doing in the face of this galling provocation ?
Four <unk> of more or less <unk> parties in different Member States have now combined into a European party , and they support that party to some extent with funds from their common groups in this Parliament .
It is very important that the public sector sets a good example as we journey towards the information society .
We also think that the minimum requirement in terms of the working environment is that a driver must not be compelled to spend his long weekly rest period in the <unk> .
The 2002 reform , therefore , must not serve just for us to carry on <unk> at our own <unk> in the form of our own Community waters , our own problems and our own <unk> .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it really does matter a great deal to me that I should start by thanking both the rapporteurs , Mr Fava and also Mrs Sanders-ten Holte .
I am of the opinion that , in the long term , all substances will need to be registered , but that in the medium- and short-term , priorities will need to be set ; the latter , however , not simply on the basis of production volumes .
For this reason , even with all the shortcomings , this agreement should be welcomed so that we can get the best out of it .
Our objective is now to decide how to manage the project &apos; s development phase .
It is the main sector in the <unk> region and accounts for a major share of top quality sales .
The issue is a humanitarian one , but not only humanitarian : it is also about the acceptance of responsibility , because if we have had four or five or six or even seven debates on Zaire , and on other situations too , in the last two or three or four months , and we read the <unk> printed in all the national and international newspapers , and yet we cannot find a solution , it is clear that something is going wrong .
We must check , not only in the automobile industry but in other sectors too , whether there is any point in creating new capacity or whether this would confuse the market and we end up with situations we can then only control by taking <unk> , i. e . , by spending more money , which is of course quite ridiculous .
<unk> will be the first to have this magnificent experience , an experience which I believe will <unk> us together - at least those fortunate enough to be in the system - and make us true Europeans , when the money in our pockets is the same as we cross the borders .
Madam President , I must say that the fact that our work this evening is being chaired by an eminent specialist in trade matters is symbolic , and I should like to thank you , as well as all those present here this evening who believe that the Doha ministerial achieved positive results .
<unk> aid and investment grants are essential for young farmers , but modern technology has an equally important part to play .
We can urge , as we do in our strong and powerful resolution , the current government at all levels of Iraq to protect religious minorities and – in this resolution – most particularly the <unk> Christians .
That is a priority for us both .
Firstly , it is based on a part of the Treaty dealing with environmental protection .
In the explanatory statement , we put a figure on the recommendation , saying that we considered there to be 0.5 % <unk> .
If Spain has such a large surplus of vets that it can afford to send so many to my country , why is it having such difficulty implementing the system of veterinary checks required by this directive ?
We should have the sort of Council that functions well and in which the main objective is the common interest .
The Bureau , which was unanimous in its view , put forward a very humane request .
We expected much more when it comes to the Council ’ s voting procedures and Parliament ’ s right to be informed and consulted , and so , in the light of a proactive policy of crisis prevention , we believe it to be necessary for us , in future , to be informed and involved as early as the <unk> and planning stages of crisis operations under the ESDP .
It is our belief that Regulation ( EEC ) No <unk> / 86 cannot be deleted without being replaced .
From 1990 to 2002 , the CO2 emissions from international air traffic that were generated by the 25 EU Member States rose by 60 % .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this particular issue and also to thank the Commissioner in advance for his ongoing work and assistance in promoting a very important aspect of European Union life : the issue of culture .
How could it be otherwise if the CFSP remains the expression of the Member States at intergovernmental level ?
In order to ensure optimum coordination of activities between the European Union and ? ? ?
? , and especially between the forces of the European Union in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and ? ? ? ?
forces , which will mainly be <unk> in Kosovo , a command base has been set up in the European Union , at the NATO base in Naples in Italy .
I can only make the general point , as I said in my main answer , and repeated in the following answer , that we do not accept that abortion should form part of policies on reproductive and birth control education .
That is really what we need !
The next item is the vote on the request for urgent procedure on the following proposal : Proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No <unk> / 1999 on the introduction of a support system for producers of certain arable crops &#91; COM ( 2001 ) 87 - <unk> / 2001 - 2001 / <unk> ( CNS ) &#93; .
One thing that I do know is that the world needs Europe .
I welcome the almost unanimous support in this Parliament for the Directive on the patenting of biotechnological inventions .
I am in favour of abolishing the exemption from tax for civil aviation fuel .
This House has passed enough resolutions for Aung San Suu Kyi to <unk> the house that remains her prison .
This question is complicated and must be considered carefully .
The second very important topic which is <unk> people is that of growth and employment .
Mr Commissioner , listen to the French lorry drivers &apos; <unk> of <unk> , listen to the same cry of <unk> from their company directors , many of whom are on a <unk> , or just <unk> .
As Mr <unk> rightly put it , Europe is going to become <unk> &apos; .
The Council must be considered in the new Treaty as a single institution , and a prime minister or president who is in office must be elected as its long-term President .
Once again I hope that the Council too will adopt them , but to be on the safe side this Parliament has amended all the preparatory actions and all the pilot projects in both category I and category III should the Council reject the actions in category I. I can only recommend : try to finance it from category I.
The margin is greater here than in category III .
<unk> to think about the way cohesion policy will have to change in the face of enlargement does not mean placing a question mark over the entire policy of enlargement .
It goes without saying that the Council will pay all the necessary attention to any proposals made by the Commission in this area .
At the same time , however , I wish to express my categorical condemnation of the manner in which assistance from donors has been used to circumvent and disregard constitutional procedures in Yugoslavia in order to bring Milosevic to the Hague tribunal .
I have seen a number of <unk> , for example , about Amendment No 7 .
Having said that , the <unk> symbolic nature of Strasbourg in the construction of Europe , its central position and the importance of not concentrating all the authorities of the European Union in Brussels , argue in favour of respecting the Treaties and retaining the city of Strasbourg as the <unk> for Parliament &apos;s sittings .
I can also see a modest role for the EU with regard to the Cabrol report on pollution .
I say this because a not insignificant number of <unk> are Christian , and Ethiopia , which is one of the two largest countries in Africa , has Christian roots .
It is hoped that the EU will be more active in the Middle East peace process in many contexts .
The Commission is proposing a reduction in the minimum number of compulsory <unk> for commercial and industrial undertakings which have received an agricultural subsidy from the Community budget , for the disposal of agricultural surpluses from the internal market or for other purposes .
Unfortunately , there was no way around these disasters or of avoiding a resolution by voting in favour of which all MEPs have agreed to join with the representatives of the Southern countries with a view to saving this budget line .
That group regularly abuses the process of negotiating joint motions .
The Union should develop its policy within this context .
Lastly , improving complementarity is important because the Treaty on European Union clearly establishes that the Member States and the Community must coordinate their policies on development cooperation and harmonise their aid programmes .
Thus , the best way of guaranteeing effective passenger rights is to ensure the smooth running of this system : to make sure that none of the rules we want to introduce <unk> this extremely sensitive , large-scale mechanism .
But how can we adjust this trend ?
Thank you very much , Mr President .
I shall not forget this , acting first and foremost as a good <unk> of collective resources .
The Council would , nonetheless , be concerned that the stability of the region should not be affected by the situation in Chechnya .
Let us now make sure , while we work for increased employment and reduced unemployment , that we do not increase unemployment in certain areas because of past decisions .
Our Group supports him , for example , on the issue of coordinating regional and private funding in the Member States of the Union .
<unk> in this field is shared between the Member States and the Union .
This also confirms the request made to the Commission on 11 December last year within the scope of the resolution on the Commission &apos;s programme of work for 1997 , to take a decision whereby the Executive undertakes to apply to the Court of Justice for <unk> sanctions to be imposed if a Member State has not taken the measures connected with the application of a Court judgment within a year , particularly in the sectors relating to the domestic market and the environment .
Because of its population , size and strategic nature , Mexico - which , under President <unk> , is <unk> in an <unk> process of reforms - is one of the powers of the American continent , and is a real bridge between the United States and Central America .
A further shipment of over 16 000 tonnes through <unk> is due to arrive on Sunday .
This will be of the utmost importance , and responsibility will lie with those working in online services .
My staff have already been working very hard to develop such a programme on the basis of current legislation for implementation at the earliest possible date .
<unk> secrecy surrounding arms transactions must disappear .
As regards the three questions put by Mr Donnelly , I would like to say that this action does not , in actual fact , strengthen employment .
The first is to say that I fully share the idea that the strategy on terrorism should not be caught between the various pillars of the European Union .
Thirdly , the sums identified as <unk> must be <unk> .
<unk> from the schedule , a great deal of work will need to be done this year .
The results can be presented in many ways , Mr President-in-Office .
There is an objective and specific risk to women , which is certainly not <unk> , when they have to use <unk> railway stations or stand waiting for public transport outside the rush hour .
The protocol on Cyprus attached to the Association Agreement also allows a margin for this development .
Mr President , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen .
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the <unk> regions that will protect people &apos; s social welfare and boost purchasing power .
I believe that , if the European political parties have one problem , it is that , in reality , they are still federations , associations , of national political parties .
If there are further delays , the Commission will examine the possibility of starting infringement proceedings against the Member States which have delayed , on the basis of Article <unk> of the Treaty .
Thank you for your attention .
On 7 November , I sent a letter to both Foreign Ministers <unk> and <unk> , in which I urged Bulgaria and Romania to take immediate and decisive action to address the gaps and shortcomings in their preparations .
Mr Turco , your comment will of course be noted , but the <unk> services inform me that the deadlines were , in principle , respected , and that all the language versions were distributed in due time , but we have taken note of your comment .
We are sitting here , <unk> our hands , writing resolutions , talking about human rights but , at the same time , we seem to have double standards .
Under your guidance , the European Parliament has accomplished an impressive political and legislative career .
Do things need to be hidden behind closed doors ?
Either we give them real technological assistance or help them economically , or it will all continue to be just empty words .
We cannot get round the fact that electricity is a fundamental cornerstone of modern society .
Thank you for that very full reply , Mr President-in-Office .
Rather than a recovery plan , it would be more appropriate to implement a management plan in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation ( EC ) No <unk> / 2002 , in a manner which is compatible and also consistent with the biological and environmental component , on the one hand , and socio-economic factors on the other , within the context of the new common fisheries policy .
The Commission promises to take many things into account in the future , but now , when a solution is required to the problem under discussion , it cannot seem to summon up the will to put pressure on the Council .
As this relationship is a very intense one , almost a <unk> relationship &apos; , it is sometimes very complex , because we demand so much from ourselves and also from our partners .
We are talking about us , not Austria .
Furthermore , the proposal that producers undertaking to <unk> up areas under <unk> will simultaneously be granted <unk> rights will also lead to a considerable expansion in production potential .
This has been the result of a process which has been completed without any form of guarantees and which has taken place in a context in which the <unk> people live with only limited democratic rights , particularly the <unk> people who live on the island of <unk> .
In conclusion , given 40 amendments of which the Commission can accept 32 in full , in part or in principle , these amendments indicate that Parliament and the Commission are clearly pursuing a common objective to ensure that the &apos; .
EU &apos; <unk> Level <unk> will soon be a successful <unk> .
One view was that if we are in favour of restricting the cultivation of tobacco , then we must offer those regions and businesses who depend on tobacco growing some alternatives , by means of compensatory payments and subsidies , so that jobs are maintained in these rural areas and so that businesses are not destroyed .
I shall end here , Mr President .
It is , after all , an annual political vote of confidence in the Commission , so there is rather more at stake if we refuse to grant discharge than simply saying , go ahead , there are no legal consequences .
The very ambitious aim is to make the European Union into the most dynamic knowledge-based economic area in the world , but this is not only significant in terms of the economy ; there are also clear implications for social policy .
That is one of the reasons why Member States within the European Union have adopted different pieces of legislation to guarantee that criminals who commit counterfeiting are vigorously punished .
When it met on 24 August in Brussels , the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly – <unk> – a sovereign assembly that <unk> together MEPs , members of the national parliaments of the 25 countries and the elected representatives of 10 Mediterranean countries , decided to send a delegation to Lebanon , Israel and Palestine .
A number of other colleagues have told me that they had had similar , though not such severe , symptoms .
Report ( <unk> / 1999 ) by Mr Hatzidakis , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the Council on the effects of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam on current legislative procedures in the area of regional policy , transport and tourism ( SEC ( 1999 ) <unk> - <unk> / 1999 ) Our rapporteur wishes to add a few words .
The debate is closed .
I was also surprised to read about item <unk> of the General <unk> to the Annual Report 2003 .
I should like to thank honourable Members for their contribution to the debate , and also to thank the President-in-Office and Mrs Gradin for having accepted Parliament &apos;s invitation at what seemed an unsuitable time for a debate of this importance .
Mr President , the Cassidy report on the Commission &apos;s annual economic report , especially the factors clearly addressed in the explanatory statement , such as economic growth , rising unemployment , the resultant conflict with economic and monetary union or the loss of popular confidence in the EU stemming from that , is to be wholeheartedly endorsed .
I might point out that on any basis we would remain the second highest net contributor to the European Union and have in this financial perspective paid billions more than <unk> countries .
We should also be taking competition seriously , considering such questions as which costs arise from the removal and disposal of waste and also in connection with the safety and security of <unk> and the standards according to which these things are done .
That process has taken place over a period of time in the <unk> to this week .
Let me seek to complete the story I began in my initial answer and hopefully address the points that the Member raised .
Thus BSE , <unk> , antibiotics and hormones threaten to <unk> our food and our bodies too .
The Commission is studying potential occurrences in order to facilitate and speed up as much as possible this process of reducing cross-border charges .
<unk> is perhaps too early for a detailed discussion of that communication .
A politician who recently died , <unk> San , a Democrat who <unk> the difficult path between the Khmer Rouge on the one hand and the <unk> puppet regime on the other , gradually pushed ahead the <unk> of a democratic Cambodia , chiefly with the help of the European Union and of the European Parliament .
Is it scheduled for later ?
This is a <unk> of <unk> , now available over the Internet .
The results that should have come with them , however , were rather less <unk> .
The task before us today is to build a new welfare state ; one which will provide opportunities , which will help those who are weakest once again , but which , at the same time , will be capable of mobilising both human and material resources to promote growth , development and long-term training .
My final conclusion is that it is high time the Member States acknowledged that these kind of issues should be tackled jointly and in conjunction with the Commission .
The Commission and the Council are based in Brussels .
<unk> our three institutions go their own ways and then try to coordinate a little at the end .
Since the Maastricht Treaty there is a general right of residence , provided the individual concerned has adequate means of subsistence and adequate health insurance protection .
However , the implementation of appropriate measures for preventing and restraining <unk> is undertaken by Member States in accordance with their own national laws and Community law .
However , I must remind you that the rule requires the Commission to check whether , in such an operation , the specified aid exceeds what is justifiable .
In order to do so effectively , it now appears necessary to reinforce the legal instruments .
It is time to consider a possible change in the way we look at our resources .
Therefore , the structure you are building with so much skill , patience and imagination is a structure that is not founded on any real principle of democracy or the rule of law .
I suggest that the article in the comes close to the truth .
The notion of the European neighbourhood policy is exactly what we need .
I had a letter from a distinguished academic the other day pointing out that persons coming to give reports are often kept waiting for their expenses money for several months .
I agree with Mr De <unk> that despite all the criticism levelled against it , the UN &apos;s usefulness cannot be disputed .
What is the solution ?
We cannot ignore the fact that this package of measures will give our people healthier air to breathe and call , hopefully , a halt to CO2 emissions .
Those of us in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party would like to reaffirm our tradition of being at the forefront in defending human rights .
I also come from a peripheral region - the <unk> and Islands of Scotland - and we have to look to the SMEs , particularly the very small ones .
<unk> is the <unk> &apos; that is required to bind the European Union together .
Mr President , since the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of the cold war numerous wars and civil wars have broken out in the world .
The <unk> European Council adopted a five-year action plan to combat drugs .
This applies both to security and to the economy , thus <unk> the present need to reinforce transatlantic relations .
Time , and the growing poverty in many developing countries , is therefore pressing .
There is one bright spot to mention , in the sense that there are another 60 000 extra tickets available .
It is right that this House should adopt a new philosophical approach to these problems .
It can never be early enough to initiate fundamental thinking on the earthquake and its consequences .
But how many of them are able to convert what are precious elements not only for the economy and society , but also for European civilisation , into real entrepreneurial development ?
Mr President , I did not dream about the Izquierdo Rojo document , which provides for aid to the producers of certain agricultural products , including <unk> .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the substantial and significant content of this directive .
The Commission &apos;s main aim in this case is to rapidly mobilise these funds .
How will the final cost of EUR <unk> million be borne within the European budget ?
With these remarks I am prepared to give my support to the report .
Integrated regional approaches are necessary but that does not mean that the European social fund should be separated from its most important task : supporting the reform of labour market measures and practices in accordance with European employment strategy , and in accordance with yearly guidelines for employment .
In this regard we are also concerned about the participation of Parliament .
This suggests that we are dealing with a very difficult issue politically speaking .
... and hearing the views unless they were going to be taken into account .
We want to learn to be responsible towards the international community in the development of our country but , after a long period of political <unk> and of fighting , we feel today that we are carrying a huge burden on our shoulders because we are responsible for the <unk> and the freedom that we have promised our people .

What we need are short term measures of confidence to relaunch the peace process , and long term measures based on the principles of international law , the most important of which we have stated : the principle of the exchange of land for peace .
As for the policies on whether or not to slaughter animals , I think that you must speak to my colleagues , Mr Byrne or Mr Fischler , as these policies are defined according to either health and consumer protection or the common agricultural policy .
.
The reason I gave so much information - like you I had access to this information - was that it could be an attempt by a private company or by groups of private companies to distort the market before the full impact of European Union law becomes legal and to interfere so that no action can be taken afterwards .
At the same , public and private institutions , particularly in the banking sector , must work together more closely .
<unk> the proposals contained in the Lamfalussy report in a fair and balanced way is of major importance to the European Union .
I can tell you that this is the number one priority as far as the candidate countries are concerned .
It is to the credit of the rapporteur that these statements did not remain <unk> <unk> but were given substance in a declaration .
.
Mr President , in this joint debate on small and medium-sized businesses I should like to talk about the report by Mr <unk> .
It is a good week for this point to be brought to our attention .
On Article 1 , the Committee on External Economic Relations proposes that reference should be made not only to Article 113 , i. e. trade policy , but also to the various other relevant statutory provisions , for example those concerning intellectual property and industrial property .
The communication will also <unk> a thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste to be adopted by the Commission , as announced , in September 2004 .
It must not be <unk> up , covered up , slowed down to please the US or anyone .
I also understand that Mrs Redondo , chairperson of Parliament &apos;s Committee on foot-and-mouth , raised the issue directly with my colleague David Byrne .
We shall now proceed to voting time .
Finally , as regards your general observation concerning the failure so far to get approval for the Philoxenia programme , and your dissatisfaction about the Council &apos;s inability , I agree that there is a problem .
Such negative behaviour , as the Commission established two years ago , is detrimental to the smooth running of the internal market and leads to a <unk> of competition to the disadvantage of the great majority of businesses which respect national legislation .
Spain has the most effective insurance system currently in place in Europe .
I applaud her intentions , but of course the question is whether the Council is going to take any notice .
This is an important point and I agree <unk> with the rapporteur .
Nor is recognition given to Parliament &apos;s role as outlined in the Commission &apos;s proposal .
With regard to the procedure , the text should be ready for approval by the Council at the end of November , following verification by the <unk> of the two institutions .
If I am a Labour MEP who has brought legislation in , I am very proud to do that because we may see a reduction of accidents in the workplace as a result of such legislation .
<unk> I to understand the answer as saying that the Council is unaware of these negotiations ?
Just look , for example , at the political interpretation made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy : ‘ The creation of the immigration liaison officers ’ network can be considered as a step in the direction towards the establishment of a common external service of the EU ... ’ This document from the Commission examines a number of changes which , in the final analysis , will affect the financial markets , and describes the technical preparations necessary .
These measures will bring significant benefits to consumers .
The next item is the joint debate on the report ( <unk> / 2005 ) by Mr Salvador Garriga Polledo on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the Fourth Amending Budget for 2005 ( <unk> ) ( <unk> / 2005 – <unk> <unk> / 2005 – 2005 / <unk> ( <unk> ) ) , I feel that the same issues will come up again in relation to telephone <unk> .
He very <unk> reminded us that we had the Convention because of the shock of Nice .
It is this that will bring the much-needed modernisation to Romania at every level .
I have written to these Commissioners .
<unk> , this session will discuss the request from the European Community for a reinforced status in <unk> for the purpose of the current negotiations on the future convention .
The principle of subsidiarity is an <unk> principle which works down the line and which should , as far as possible , enable people with local knowledge to apply that local knowledge , with common sense , to local circumstances , taking account of the purposes of the European legislation in question .
To that extent I must again , being logical , reject it .
It is important in a union of fifteen countries that we teach our children about our common history and heritage .
In any case , I cannot commit myself to more human resources , since you all know how difficult an issue that is .
Mr President , I wish to ask whether , following the vote on Amendment No 13 , Amendments Nos 56 and 57 should now lapse .
The liberal group will be voting against the relevant amendments and in favour of the common position .
The conclusion is evident : the need to communicate our projects is crucial for the future of the European Union .
I should remind the House that we will be continuing our discussions in Helsinki , and there are two things we hope to establish in the form of agreements .
That is , as far as I am concerned , also a reason to call on the Turkish Government again to press ahead with the abolition of these state security courts - which has already been announced - because they are once again the source of much misery .
The European Parliament and the European Union as a whole must send out a clear message condemning the murders and all who participate in committing such crimes .
Mr President , I very much welcome this report on the transportation of radioactive material within the European Union .
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply , from which I understand that the Council really is aware of the problem and is making efforts in the right direction .
It can be compared to <unk> <unk> under the tap to stop a flood without considering the possibility of at least turning down the tap a little to reduce the flow of water .
However , I would also like to express certain concerns with regard to the economic restrictions .
I am sure that this <unk> will bring us good fortune , perhaps not all year - since it has only <unk> a little - but maybe at least for this weekend , which I hope will be a pleasant one for you all .
The mobile revolution could greatly increase their <unk> to <unk> .
I think it is disgraceful to change things without prior agreement .
I agree that European companies must be given the same conditions as their American counterparts , and it would be excellent if a working capital market could be established as part of this process , otherwise we run the risk of the good ideas being exploited elsewhere .
This view was promoted in particular by the man formerly responsible for the United States &apos; strategic nuclear weapons , General <unk> <unk> , who himself literally had his finger on the nuclear <unk> for many years .
The developments in Ukraine are , of course , the latest example of the EU being able to support democratic developments in countries that are its close neighbours .
We need to examine the implications of this crisis within the European Union and the international community and the UN and decide how to tackle them .
The fear , however , is that of finding or not finding a job , and not the fear of finding or not finding one ’ s own country .
The way in which Europeans have so far handled the issue of burden sharing can only be described as a complete tragedy .
We can see that from the report that we are considering .
In particular , transparency is to be achieved by providing information for the general public and access to the institutions &apos; documents .
We have reason to fear that there is a connection between these disappearances and the country &apos;s political problems .
We believe that the European <unk> <unk> and the European Public Prosecutor unnecessarily <unk> upon <unk> &apos; own legal systems and are therefore undesirable .
Amendment No 6 - which <unk> that candidates who have already fulfilled their professional competence requirement , should not be requested to so a second time - arises from a misunderstanding of the Commission proposal .
If the main aim is still to achieve wide global agreements , this is because there is <unk> of 30 % , and that state aid is therefore a <unk> of competition .
It seems to me premature , however , in the context of a report on employment and integration , to give third country nationals the right to vote in local and European elections .
The European Union , and for a start , the Commission , should perhaps pay more attention to that area , because in my opinion , it will be a source of further conflict .
Then there is the issue of the relationship between the Commission and national agencies , that is , decentralisation .
You yourself stressed the obvious need for a trade agreement with unambiguous rules , and the negotiations have also been going on too long already , but what we need is an agreement with fair conditions for both parties .
This was because they were completely <unk> out by countries which also claim to be underdeveloped but whose interests are fundamentally different from , or even opposed to , the interests of these poorest countries .

Consequently , education and training assist the better development of the abilities of individual people and their participation in society .
Parliament continued to insist that this was very important because the more powerful and larger the vehicle , the greater its level of emissions , and we considered it important that this be included in one of the <unk> .

There is no alternative to a strategic partnership between the European Union and the Russian Federation that is reliable , sustainable and mutually advantageous .
You have our support as we go this way together .
The cost of buying 100 000 tonnes of beef into intervention has to be estimated at around ECU 200 million .
It is fair to say , as expressed by <unk> <unk> , that the immense welcome the agreement has received from our friends across the world and in particular from within the European Union underlines its truly historic and <unk> nature .
On the other hand , we cannot contradict the very values that we seek to uphold and that we affirm .
This is what we would like to see happen in Cuba .
These include the proposal that the Commission would be authorised to levy a management charge on the <unk> for services provided .
In particular , with a view to the forthcoming Stockholm employment summit , I think we may have to develop some methods which might improve the evaluation of the goals gradually achieved , and emphasise the need to intervene forcefully and rapidly when those objectives are not achieved .
It is practically impossible .
It is clear that industry has enough sound scientific evidence to try to counteract the activities of the environmental and health movements .
The proposal is to set up an integrated programme for 2007 / 2013 , <unk> into six separate <unk> ( <unk> , Erasmus , Leonardo da <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> Monnet ) , the overall budget for which falls short of what is required , in light of the scope and the range of situations covered .
Either Europe - north and south - has a single currency by 2002 , or else we shall have wasted this opportunity for an entire generation .
We must first of all give the poor a stake in their rural economies so that they may own their own land and have an opportunity to build their lives .
We cannot permit nationalism , racism , and what amounts to a <unk> and crude form of fascism , to take hold on this continent .
I trust that we will take the very many positive ideas and words of this debate forward into practical and effective steps , which will be to the mutual advantage of both sides .
In this context , the European Union has declared its readiness to take the necessary steps by treating India and Pakistan as equals .
The budgetary savings proposed mean it would no longer be possible to compensate aids to beef farmers , but would make it possible to save <unk> billion ECU from the farming budget ( <unk> .
Does he agree with me that it is somewhat ironic that a country like India , which has call centres from European companies selling insurance , <unk> , loans and other financial services to Europeans , denies those very services to its own people , and will he press India in particular to reform its protectionist system for financial services ?
The reason is that is very important that we keep to the 1999 starting date and that progress is not impeded by certain very small percentages .
We are told the digital age promises a revolution in the development of content and the distribution of images , and the MEDIA <unk> programme <unk> space to pilot projects , such as the digital transposition of our audiovisual heritage .
In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty .
I should like to conclude by saying that my personal experience has taught me that openness and transparency are of great value in <unk> fraud and corruption in an organisation .
This good economic sense is demonstrated to us by our American friends .
The political problem is a different problem .
It has repercussions for both the protection of the environment and passenger safety .
The review of the European Union ’ s Sustainable Development Strategy is about how we can do things better to get results : first , about how we design policy , including policies within the Lisbon Agenda ; second , about implementing what has been agreed ; third , about making sure that we involve all those who need to act .
I am slightly less pleased with Mr Kuckelkorn &apos; s tabling of amendments , because he has tabled a great many and they go beyond the requirements of the current objective .
As you have pointed out quite rightly , my country , Spain , has brought the date forward , as have certain others , but we must all continue to work in the same direction , because , the longer the transitional period <unk> , the more harm will be done to the television broadcasters , the <unk> industry , the manufacturing and marketing industry , the distribution sector and , above all , the citizens themselves .
Mr President , like everyone else in this debate I should like to congratulate Mr Lannoye .
Consequently , the young people from the countries now joining the Union , who will be able to compete on the labour market of the current fifteen , are an asset and not a problem .
That is not where the problem lies and we have allowed derogations for these craft .
The fact of the matter is that even the rule on category 4 <unk> is not entirely without its problematic aspects , as it means that the environment in the affected areas will be subjected to new <unk> .
I should now like to turn to the Langen report , naturally to announce that our group will be voting in favour , but also to ask colleagues and the rapporteur to consider the two amendments put forward by Mr <unk> and myself .
I have no doubt that Mr <unk> does take a racist attitude towards southern <unk> , among others , but I would certainly not regard the entire Liberal Group as racist , in line with the <unk> <unk> &apos; logic which says that if you are a racist , therefore you are right-wing , and simply because you are right-wing , therefore you are a racist .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like at the outset to reiterate my thanks to my <unk> of the Committee for their constructive cooperation , but would also like to thank the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspective , which has played a substantial part in ensuring , not only that PROGRESS is now a good instrument for the better implementation of the social policy agenda , but also that we will have enough money to be able to really ensure greater sustainability .
Now , 59 years later , there is true <unk> , and Europe is free .

We very much hoped that this would pressure national governments - especially our own - to produce a better deal .
It is certainly true that there are different approaches to integration represented in the Member States .
The murdered couple were employees of the renowned <unk> institute <unk> .
We have already had many discussions in this House which have highlighted the need to support small businesses and the self-employed , along with the need for bureaucracy in tendering procedures to be reduced at the same time as transparency and <unk> are increased .
On the one hand , the Council is completely obsessed with the revision of the financial perspectives and it wants to impose on Parliament a clause which goes against the rights conferred on Parliament under the Treaties .
No , they are not .
I regard this conference as a truly important result of this summit , as you yourself , Commissioner , have just said .
I was <unk> for Portugal for as long as I possibly could , though .
I do not want the future to <unk> more wars but we know that there will be many more conflicts .
This is quite clear , just from reading the relevant literature .
The rapporteur gives me no option but to disagree with him .
In this respect , I would like to reassure Mrs Schroedter and point out that we will keep her informed .
As regards available funds , the Commission suggests a financial framework for 2003 to 2006 , which would be divided up at a ratio of 60 % for Asia and 40 % for Latin America , totalling EUR <unk> billion .
However , I agree with the President-in-Office that it is rather worrying that it appears to be so difficult to get a package of sanctions approved , and approved in such a way that the Member States are forced to take tough measures without backing down .
Despite that , I believe that success shows that we have done the right thing .
For this reason , I cannot support Amendment 57 , which I believe would threaten the chances of reaching a <unk> first reading agreement in the interests of all concerned .
In various different countries of the world , we have <unk> borders , united in the refusal to abide by national <unk> .
But , in this area , I believe that what makes life hard to tolerate is this civilization of <unk> , cold , hard <unk> that disregards the needs of human <unk> , needs that are satisfied by a sense of family , by religious faith and by the greatly <unk> sentiment of patriotism .
If only the EU sought reform in the WTO with the same <unk> it has won the USD 4 billion trade sanctions against the United States in relation to our steel exports , perhaps the poorest countries would start to believe us when we say we want a development round .
As Parliament , we cannot afford in the public &apos; s eyes , to deliberately cause delays .
According to yesterday &apos;s <unk> <unk> newspaper , &apos; Nothing is more exciting to the public than what is supposedly not there &apos; .
I will be interested to know how the Commission and the Council would react if we voted through this amendment to give an extra EUR 500 million next year for the rebuilding of Iraq .
In the days and weeks ahead , we need steady <unk> and an effective United Nations .
I voted against this report and I was not alone in doing so .
I also hope that it will force the UK <unk> and Miss <unk> , as Economic Secretary , to pay their bills on time .
We have been constructive , we accepted the total removal of labour law from the Directive .
At the same time , however , it is proposing that the money should come from the Rural Development and Structural Funds , and there are a number of reasons for thinking that the primary source of funding is intended to be rural development , as no separate fund exists for Natura 2000 .
We call upon the states of the region to use the mechanisms of the OSCE , as well as any other appropriate peaceful instruments , to resolve that dispute quickly .
So much the better , glad to hear it , nothing against that .
But in their interest and in the interest of the Community as a whole , certain basic measures based on realism must be taken in various areas .
It is not just a problem of Tunisia ’ s Arab culture : it is a common problem with developing countries .
These people have no choice : either forced labour or prison .
It only has at its disposal the specific powers conferred by the treaty .
The same goes for the rapporteur , who was prepared – although he has since become rather less so – to work together with the major groups and the Commission in finding a rational way forward .
Does the UK Presidency divide autonomy into good and bad ?
So what we have here is a carefully considered package which is advantageous to each party , I would venture to say each Member State of the European Union .
Mr President , I rise as the rapporteur on the draft recommendation from the European Commission on the provision of minimum criteria for environmental inspections .
So we have to be realistic and sensible in what we hope ultimately to achieve .
My Group is also interested , of course , in the rapid implementation of this directive , and we wish to avoid a conciliation procedure .
As a UK Member of this Parliament I understand other Members &apos; concerns .
The negotiations for the Youth programme have dragged on for around one and three quarter years .
Member States have not had the courage to go as far as to introduce the sorts of provisions that currently apply in Austria .
Ladies and gentlemen , I am afraid we are wasting time .
The main points of the proposal for a directive which have been modified by the common position of the Council are the following .
Voting will take place at 5.30 p. m . My country must continue to regulate access to the labour market for at least the next three years .
Mr President , the military regime in Burma continues to <unk> political opponents without restraint .
I would also ask the Commissioner to initiate something of a uniform European approach to the issue of animal <unk> and the collection thereof .
<unk> the food safety bodies of Member States to the authority through an advisory committee comprising the national directors of such bodies .
There is no doubt that at the moment the answer to that question is &apos;no &apos; .
For these reasons , I voted for the resolution .
Another enemy is terrorism , and here too we are right behind Israel in combating all forms of terrorism , including the - appalling - series of suicide attacks .
To move on now to the controversial issue of voluntary and unpaid donation , the liberal group is satisfied with the compromise that was reached , a better compromise than the one reached for directive 100 .
Therefore , the key is to get <unk> , to make the system workable , to protect health , to reduce the number of animal tests and to achieve it all in ten years .
The Financial Regulation cannot rate higher than a basic act or than this budgetary authority .
I would be grateful if you could take note of this .
Its subject is the establishment of a European Guarantee Fund to promote <unk> and television production .
We may have a very high degree of sympathy with the <unk> behind the <unk> legislature but you really cannot have a world trading system in which the particular way of imposing pressure on a country is determined by one state in one country with <unk> affects upon the rest of the trading world .
However , I would like to address a question to both the Council and the Commission , in relation to the decision which was made in <unk> on 12 January 2006 by the <unk> countries , namely , China , India , South Korea , Japan , the United States and Australia , when they decided that they represent 45 % of the world ’ s population and account for almost half of the greenhouse gas emissions .
On the other hand , where there was disagreement was the fact of knowing how to transfer the 1 billion ECU which , following the decision to adapt 1996 , had already been <unk> to 1998 .
Unfortunately , this <unk> of awareness has come very late in the day , perhaps even too late .
Establishing safety and confidence when we are faced with <unk> is another area which calls for a collective response on a global scale , given the world-wide dimension of the Internet .
The European Union is in need of a reliable , Europe-wide transport system that effectively guarantees trade and mobility .
I am certainly in favour of having the vote tomorrow , if that is more <unk> for everybody , but , Mr President , I am absolutely against any possibility of having all the amendments and all the calls for secret <unk> <unk> , because it is unthinkable that all the secret <unk> could simply be <unk> out like that .
This type of Europe is not the European Europe for which I have fought for 40 years .
After the completion of the procedure for the legislative programme for 1996 there was general agreement between the Commission and Parliament that the existing arrangements were seriously in need of reform .
This is something which affects not only the will and the everyday lives of our citizens but also the proper functioning of the single market .
Why are women not being voted for , then , if more than half of the electorate are women ?
( Applause ) I must agree with that analysis and , whilst <unk> Mr <unk> ’ s speech today , I cannot see that it takes us anywhere useful at all .
Some of the 30 cases in Germany are so dramatic that I want to describe one of them to you .
These are three subjects that genuinely make us angry and that prove that not everything in Europe ’ s <unk> is coming up <unk> .
Turkey itself is undergoing the process of transition to a normal society , which is something the <unk> constitution of <unk> <unk> cannot live up to , for in my mind this constitution does not allow sufficient scope for religious freedom and for the religious activities of its citizens .
In your report and during the debate , your proposals regarding the basic principles of the structural fund reform in the Santer package , which relate to the reduction in the number of funds , budgetary structure , <unk> and linking credits and loans more closely , also reflect central concerns of the Commission .
I am satisfied because we have included an advisory body in the overall programme planning and implementation procedure .
I look forward to early Polish membership .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by congratulating Mr <unk> Maaten on his <unk> report .
I believe , however , that with a European Constitution which incorporates the Charter of Fundamental Rights , we will have the ability to make progress in a direction that will enable us to profoundly change the Europe we have today and of which I am critical .
All foods which are to enter the <unk> and receive a European label of quality will have to have been monitored throughout the food chain .
I am quite sure that we in the European Union can do this .
Let us give it another name , because it <unk> with other implications .
I think the best thing would be to consider <unk> as an <unk> commodity and thus take it as a starting point that Annex I substances must not be added to it .
The conclusions of the European Council in Nice could announce , in the way you recommend , a mandate and timetable for the work on matters of a constitutional nature .
I actually believe that , from the humanitarian point of view , the problem is one of coordination .
As far as this problem is concerned , I would like to remind you that the Commission wanted to resolve this question a year ago , but was not supported by the Member States .
These two proposals will follow very closely the consultations launched by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees .
And to pretend that all we need to do is press a switch to make everything better is simply an illusion .
I tried to tell the House that , as some colleagues know , almost all my livestock <unk> foot-and-mouth disease and were slaughtered .
As a consequence , we demand with insistence that the Heads of State and Government firmly stick to a European foreign policy that expresses an alliance of sovereign states .
I think that the freedom of the press is endangered from time to time in the majority of Lomé states , and that it is true that <unk> is the <unk> <unk> in the country of the blind .
It is clear that what we need is sustainable positions across the globe whether it is in the United States , Europe , Japan or indeed in the developing world .
Mr President , in this report , I propose rejection of the Italian initiative organising joint flights for the removal of illegal nationals , and I do so for two reasons .
Our goal for the Summit is to maintain the recent dynamic in transatlantic relations .
We must be more effective .
Nor do we accept treaty changes without unanimity and ratification .
You somewhat remind me of your <unk> Tony Blair .
We must leave that to the consultation system within the company concerned .
Amendments reflecting this compromise package have also been tabled for the vote later today .
But he made a mistake , as we are wont to do when we read our speeches quickly in politics .
We are therefore prepared to monitor the effects of this initiative and its results very carefully and to examine , if need be together with the ACP States , the measures which might be required in order to preserve their competitive position in the Community &apos; s markets .
However , cooperation has been spread over a number of different programmes , including , and this is just one example , the <unk> programme - the International Association for the Promotion of Cooperation with <unk> from the new Independent States of the former Soviet Union .
This is dangerous ground , therefore , and it is clear that we must pursue this topic .
We have the <unk> programme which concerns training and exchanging experiences in the area of immigration , not least where the <unk> of forged documents is concerned .
The next item is the report ( <unk> / 1999 ) by Mrs Torres Marques , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the report from the Commission to the Council : <unk> of the transitional period related to the introduction of the euro ( COM ( 99 ) 174 - <unk> ­ <unk> / 1999 ) .
I must confess that I have some doubts about the smoke screen that he has raised with regard to the length of his term of office .
However , in my opinion , sustainability is a principle that ought not solely to take account of environmental considerations , rather it is equally important to make economic and social considerations part of the concept .
And are the rumours we sometimes hear in this Parliament true that hundreds of thousands of young girls and children are being brought illegally into the EU from the candidate countries ?
What is needed are <unk> instruments , such as European action plans , but we are not yet mature enough for those either .
Mr President , Commissioner , this report cannot be <unk> from the European context .
The European Union has developed an agricultural model which is designed to establish framework conditions for all farmers in Europe , regardless of location - even in less-favoured and peripheral regions - to operate effectively with a secure income .
As far as the UK is concerned , existing noise regulations have been well thought through and these tighter regulations at EU level are neither necessary nor appropriate .
Some of the recommendations made by the experts were thus able to be taken into consideration .
Let me remind you – as I know you are well aware – that there are issues that genuinely make us angry and to which we are vehemently opposed , such as part-time work , prostitution and abortion .
On the other hand , if that new policy is a confirmation of Mr Chirac or Mr Prodi &apos;s approaches , then I think we are heading straight for disaster .
First of all , I should like to express my satisfaction that the protection of children is , gradually , becoming a priority concern for all the European institutions .
Our trading relationship , which has declined over previous years , should improve markedly now that we are able to compete on a level playing field with the US and Canadian products and services .
My hope is that , aided by the Commission ’ s <unk> and this House ’ s courage , this further step may be taken .
In a globalised world , politics , diplomacy , internal security and defence must be combined to address these new types of threat .
In those surroundings , a <unk> developed , a kind of infectious <unk> driven by the federalists ; it caused many members to lose sight of their national positions and interests and they had their revenge later .
The plans must thus also take account of that .
Madam President , I hope we are capable of overcoming this first great crisis which is currently facing us in the European Union .
We must also try to prevent large , uncontrolled migrant flows to the European Union .
The prospect of an agreement with China is crucial for European operators in the long term .
It is worrying that in some Member States , EMU discipline rests on one-off measures and not on structural change .
This is linked to the report which we have already debated at some length .
Unfortunately , it did not attract majority support in the main reporting committee , the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy .
Many transactions in banking and <unk> are already taking place online .
The European Union must not be content with making appeals , but must set a crystal-clear example , and I hope that the Commission will join with the next Presidency in launching an appropriate initiative .
First , EU-US relations are truly unique and <unk> .
I myself wrote to the two heads of the executive on 20 April this year to ask them to ensure that this group was made up of all the political elements elected at the European elections .
The large <unk> <unk> of factories and power stations , but also cars spring to mind .
I have compared the English , French and German versions .
Today , Europe is facing a similar challenge , and we know that , just as history has been <unk> in the past , it will not be <unk> in the present .
<unk> are presented at the outset which everyone knows , on both the Parliament and Council sides , will ultimately be unacceptable for the other party .
I believe it is the duty of every Member State government to protect the innocent , not the perpetrators of violence .
In agriculture we need sustainability , especially with regard to <unk> factors .
In April only half of the money <unk> at the December conference had actually been committed .
Both are essential if we are to have effective policies for helping young people to stay off drugs and for tackling drugs traffickers and their <unk> .
In fact , parliamentarians can also be involved and , in reality , were in fact originally involved in our own wealthy part of the world before the NGOs came on the scene .
This is an important task and the opinion sought from Parliament by the Austrian Presidency in <unk> will be accorded its full weight .
Reference has already been made to the evaluation process and to the agreement that has been reached to the effect that preventive and <unk> work has to be carried out in close consultation with the operators .
Allow me , therefore , to ask you what Mr Patten asked the Members of this Parliament : is the Council unanimous ?
As far back as 1995 , the World Bank condemned the European banana policy .
The answer is that the Council failed to reach a common position in December and the Commission is supporting the Portuguese presidency in its effort to make progress in parallel with the progress on this proposal .
This crucial market will also be incapable of growing stronger unless there is a shared vision of the use of the various forms of energy production .
As the European Parliament delegation to Belarus , we have submitted the relevant document to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Solana .
The final point I would like to make is one which I have made before and will continue to make .
We all know that animal welfare is an incredibly difficult issue in the WTO .
When will the European Union finally take the decision to ban access to its territorial waters to any ship that does not comply with the rules it <unk> ?
The average difference in the EU is still 16 % .
Such operations have long been considered with a certain degree of <unk> .
I believe this report deals with an extremely emotive subject because we simply must not forget that both the <unk> and the <unk> , just like the <unk> forests to which Mr Kreissl-Dörfler is constantly referring , are fundamental elements for maintaining the overall ecological balance on this planet .
Furthermore , the procedures for levying anti-dumping and <unk> duties need to be consistently applied in accordance with the General Agreement on <unk> and Trade .
So I thank you for your speech and I leave you with that commitment , in the hope of a positive summit .
Not only because they explain and list practically all the aspects that have to be taken into consideration in a joint strategy to intensify <unk> American relations , but they also deserve our support because they come at just the right time , prior to the preparations for the second Heads of State and Government Summit to be held next May .
Secondly , as far as common security is concerned , the only decisive action is still the prohibition of <unk> mines , while in the field of human rights , we , personally , would prefer to see the European Union doing more about the constantly threatened security of its own citizens before worrying about what is happening outside its common borders .
As the largest democracy in the world , India must demonstrate its wisdom and bring to an end the vicious <unk> in the proliferation of nuclear weapons .
At a time when the world is waiting for conversion projects for the arms industry and for clear signs of disarmament , these documents equate the competitive advantage of the arms industry with the competitiveness and viability of European industry as a whole .
For example a small Member State like Finland has to finance this reduction with a sum corresponding to the annual running costs of an <unk> university .
These are matters with major implications .
In the Commission &apos;s press release in June it noted that these two aspects have been separated .
It suggests that a range of Community programmes , including <unk> and <unk> , could be developed and used more effectively to combat trafficking in women , support the victims and enable them to rebuild their lives .
So here too , the euro should make a big difference to our unemployment problem .
This involves , for example , agreements on reporting and transparency such as , firstly , asking agencies to report on any changes to their budgets to the budgetary authority ; secondly , reporting of their <unk> and work programmes for consideration in the drawing up of their budgets .
We cannot ignore the fact that the political <unk> of the Lebanese authorities are still dominated by Syria and that <unk> has a decisive influence over the position of the Lebanese Government in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process , despite the Israeli army &apos;s withdrawal from Southern Lebanon in May 2000 .
The Commission &apos;s proposal for a new tariff quota for certain fish species merits support , but more desirable still , in all honesty , is a doubling of the quota for sea <unk> and sea <unk> , as the rapporteur proposes .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by expressing my thanks to Mrs <unk> for her good work in connection with both readings of this draft directive .
We hope - although we are none of us sure - that Milosevic will recognise the seriousness of the situation and use the time to negotiate and not to break this agreement again .
She assured me that the constitutional court has taken measures concerning the legal personality of religious communities and their ability to acquire property and that those measures have actually obtained or will obtain legal force .
Safety must be given priority .
Later , in the summer , something unexpected happened : the earthquake in Turkey .
It is not that we need another year or two because we have elections next year ; it is that we need a solution for the future !
I should just like to ask again about Amendment No 42 and to hear the views of the Commission on it .

Natura 2000 can work only with the active support of local communities , NGOs , and <unk> and file people – men and women , young and old , who just like the <unk> of nature without any political statement .
Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group and the Committee on Budgets , I rise to speak on Mr Tillich &apos;s report .
But you , as the President of the sitting , are able to have the vote taken again as a roll-call vote .
As your rapporteur , I will therefore closely follow how the Commission and the Member States tackle this problem in the near future .
We will monitor carefully in the context of the existing directives how the purpose of transparency , economic efficiency and <unk> will be applied .

I do not share Commissioner Bjerregaard &apos;s and Council representative <unk> &apos;s view that , in order to really be able to do something about the problem , the EU should not take a lead and introduce binding commitments unless other industrialized countries also do so .
We know that Europe is capable of developing a lot more than it is developing at the moment .
We cannot build a common currency on mass unemployment and the voters have now clearly shown that .
In conclusion , I should like to say that thanks to your intervening , Commissioner , important progress has been made on this directive , and I should specifically like to thank you for that .
That is what the port owners say themselves and these port owners would see their incentive for vital new investments destroyed .
As many have pointed out , there are serious problems in Afghanistan today .
The 21 amendments will enable us to have a free market , with companies competing in the market rather than in a court of law , and so I ask you to support these 21 amendments , which we urgently need if European innovation is to develop .
We have Sir Leon who <unk> a lot , who makes <unk> or <unk> speeches - we do not really know - about one or two matters relating to human rights , but there is no European policy towards China .
Now , in the fresh modification of the Treaties expected at the outcome of the present Intergovernmental Conference , we must progress to a more open and democratic operation of all the European institutions , as Mrs Ahern &apos;s report states in its conclusions .
The relevant proposal was put forward by the European Commission two years ago , and was adopted by the European Parliament last year .
Russia must comply with international agreements , and Parliament should call on the Commission to take action and negotiate with Russia to ensure that it too <unk> to these agreements , provides its neighbouring countries with sufficient information , is prepared to accept help and also takes adequate action itself .
Mr President , when a mission from the Committee on Development visited Darfur in September 2004 , we were shocked to see at first hand people <unk> under <unk> because their village had been bombed .
( The President noted that more than 12 Members rose to oppose moving the oral amendment ) I think that was the case .
Because this uncertainty exists .
However , I am unable to support the proposal on data storage .
Do you think that , when we legislate about chemicals , we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future ?
The reforms announced by President <unk> Ali in November are precisely in the spirit and the letter of the last resolution adopted by this Parliament , and what is needed now is for them to become a reality .
There are a number of points that I wish to make today .
.
Nobody in Europe can or should hope to profit from this .
We know that we cannot <unk> our efforts , but rather , as Mr Lagendijk has argued , we need to redouble those efforts .
We do not wish to question the rights of the people to determine their own affairs , but we do ask that they respect the terms of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the <unk> anniversary of which we are marking this week .
However , a number of Members in our House do not seem to be familiar with the scientific analyses which the judgement of these international organizations is based upon , and they tend to deal with the issue of <unk> of foodstuffs at an emotional level , even though the political decisions must be made using reliable scientific data .
<unk> and <unk> are the enemy of success and of a successful enterprise economy .
The Commission has so far provided all reasonable support possible and all the programmes that can be used will continue to be used to help Malta solve the problem .
Some people who have spoken have looked for <unk> .
It is extremely important that the Vienna summit meeting send a strong signal that Europe intends to play its part in helping to bring stability to the global economy .
These are the areas where we must focus our efforts to build new policies .
In the mean time , we must welcome the move from arms to the political arena , as demonstrated by the agreement that the Maoists have signed with the <unk> coalition to hold elections to a constituent assembly in the near future .

It is hoped that the proposal for a new European Parliament and Council directive will be adopted by the Commission in July 1996 .
<unk> and future relations between the European Union and the African Union must be built on the basis of respect for human rights standards .
It is , for example , regrettable that projects , particularly innovative ones , should be so behind in comparison to what is at stake in the next few years .
I want it to reinstate the Human Rights Commission .
We have received the opinion of the Director of the Monitoring Centre on the matter , we have asked our budget rapporteur to investigate more widely the question of the Austrian government &apos;s attitude to the European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia .
Even though opinions are divided on the matter , and the position currently held by the Council is quite clear , I am absolutely convinced that this is an important issue that requires our attention .
With these investigations it must also be considered to what extent the long-term objectives can be achieved by 2020 .
I think that Objective 1 must be the point on which the strongest emphasis is placed .
For without it the follow-up reports already demanded of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities by the Conference of Presidents , will be meaningless .
So at last we are getting together to debate this issue , and together we should try to make the best of it .
Not to incorporate legal guarantees still existing in national legislation , when elements of national legislation concerning internal security have been delegated to the European Union , only reinforces the permanent , <unk> <unk> which is felt about the procedures of the European Union .

It is very clear in this communication that the new open method does not replace the existing methods .

Indeed , the Commission &apos;s action plan for free movement of workers adopted on 12 November 1997 highlighted the important role of cross-border mobility in the Union .
The services directive , as proposed by the previous Commission , was a noble and very innovative attempt to do something dramatic in this vital area .
And they will do so , of that I am confident .
However , we do not want to place more emphasis on this than on other legal concerns , such as human rights and minority rights .
I recently had a long and interesting <unk> in Scotland with the <unk> General for India and we were reflecting upon the problems in trying to constitute a <unk> which is continental in scale and <unk> in character , with citizens of many <unk> and of none , with memories of historical <unk> between religious communities and which tries to sustain a working democratic constitution and to live at peace with its neighbours .
We object , however , to the EU ’ s threat to introduce protectionist measures in relation to India at a time when the EU is <unk> its own agricultural products and dumping them on the Indian market .

I have come to the conclusion that , if there is to be agreement , there is in any case an absolute need for more dialogue and for more intensive efforts among the members of the WTO .
This is all the more true since the majority of sugar factories in Poland are under foreign control .
Furthermore , we need to make shareholders more responsible and more involved .
The key point - and there is a high degree of unanimity on this within the Chamber - is money .
What we are condemning is this : the Greek National Radio and Television Council made a judgment , clearly based on moral grounds , although this was not within its competence to do so , and decided to fine a private television station for showing two men <unk> .
( Applause ) If you open up and liberalise the markets without imposing conditions , you simply have to expect other producers to seize their opportunity and benefit from it by <unk> <unk> into the <unk> markets .
But , secondly , we are calling for practical support for speeding up the restructuring of companies in order to increase competitiveness and in order to guarantee their future within the new global framework .
Mr President of the European Parliament ... no , EB of the EB , Mr President of the European Parliament ... no , EB , EB .
But the terrorists must be in no doubt : they will be pursued with rigour , with no regard to race and religion .
Thanks to this impressive , patient , <unk> work – for which I would like publicly to thank all those involved , in particular the Minister for Foreign Affairs , Mr Frattini , who is sitting here on my right we have been able to resolve almost all the questions raised by the IGC participants without much <unk> the overall level of ambition of the Convention ’ s draft .
The Commission ’ s role should be to coordinate , not to dictate .
I believe all support for both production and export should cease within a few years .
Mr Lukashenko &apos;s regime does not perhaps meet the criteria of our democracies which are themselves , moreover , far from being perfect and , even , increasingly devoid of any content as national sovereignty is progressively <unk> .
We maintain that the <unk> public service , which is of particular structural value in terms of regional planning and social cohesion , such as postal , railway and energy services , etc . , must be defended against the Commission &apos; s position .
I have been recalled by the Presidency to be in Paris as soon as possible .
We did adopt this resolution last time but reports have reached me in the meantime to the effect that there has been no improvement whatsoever in the situation .
Mr President , the previous speakers have told the House about dramatic cases in which Syrian <unk> have been detained in recent months , and yet violations of fundamental rights have been taking place in Syria for over 40 years .
But they also have socio-economic implications , not only for those who fish cod and hake , but also for fishermen whose livelihood depends on stocks associated with either of these fisheries .
<unk> should be closely involved in pilot projects regarding the introduction of the euro , particularly at the early stage .
Certainly the Commission will seek good coordination with national employment policies .
Budgetary policy should therefore tend towards the <unk> of expenditure to help to create employment and improve the well-being and safety of the citizens , not to reduce that .
( Parliament adopted the resolution ) Each extra ECU coming into the budget is worth as much as an ECU saved on the expenditure side .
According to Mrs Schaffner , only nationals of an EU Member State are citizens of the Union .
On this issue , as on others , we believed it was important , over and above the basic approach , to open up a debate , to take time to consider the <unk> and <unk> of the different options , and to decide between <unk> reactions that would consist of changing as little as possible and the long-term requirements of giving our institutions new impetus .
I share his indignation as regards the assessment of Parliament &apos;s powers in this matter .
In the conflict over the EU ’ s future finances , there are two options : either to carry on <unk> through , repeating the sins of the past and trying to fund everything at once , or – the second option – to see the future framework for the EU budget as an opportunity .
I know these forms assist in controlling fraud but there should be a greater degree of flexibility at local level .
As a final point on this aspect of the matter , <unk> President Delors , as it were , may I also say that the European Union does not always succeed in providing itself with the resources to achieve its own ambitions .
This is why the declaration on sport in the Treaty of Amsterdam annex is no longer sufficient to ensure that the predetermined objectives are met .
The agreement expires on 30 November and the mandate for negotiation does not extend beyond October this year .
These actions are also being implemented or examined under TACIS .
It is , of course , the progress , indeed great progress , made that ensures that we are supporting this legislation despite everything .
I hope , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that Gothenburg will be able to translate these principles into common objectives .
A Europe of citizens exists , day after day , on our roads , and I think that much could be done , if only to harmonize all the signs and instructions , all the illustrated warnings , which add nothing to the <unk> of Europe but which make life difficult for European citizens when they travel .
This draft resolution was <unk> by a Chinese <unk> motion .
That <unk> of competences varies from one State to another and , furthermore , they vary greatly in many countries .
At present , Member States which do not want to violate the trade agreement in giving preferential treatment to exports from such illegal settlements have only been able to recover some limited duties , mainly relying on Israel to refrain from answering verification questions .
Unfortunately , I was unable to attend this presentation , Commissioner , but I should like to congratulate you on it all the same .
They did not do so .
<unk> issues will be a major focus of the Commission ’ s work in this field .
So this is more than just food aid .
A positive point , certainly , is that the programme is open to third countries .
In this regard , the spirit of the report , which stresses the importance of cooperation between the Council and Parliament , is very good .
Mr President , what has been proposed here is a very dangerous situation in which immigrants and asylum seekers are being treated like criminals in that they are to be <unk> .
I am proud to be associated with this step and I shall be very interested to hear from the Commissioner , who is here today , whether the Commission intends to respond positively to this request by Parliament .
In its Annual Interim Report on the Lisbon Strategy published on 25 January ahead of the next Spring European Council , the Commission says that although it recognises the significant progress made since then , the priority is now to produce results and the time has come to speed up the reforms .
Applause She also failed to deal with issues such as <unk> with development issues and the very strong trade complex that we had .
I will only mention here one aspect of this aid , relating to the restoration of security , which is still too frequently under threat in some provinces .
That link has to be taken into consideration .
Competition law is not interested in pure sporting rules , only the economic activities connected with sporting events .
I would like finally to thank all the workers in this institution without whose work we would not be able to carry out our own .
It was a truly <unk> event that included a discussion on how to create the conditions for improving not only the dialogue but also the environment for freedom and democracy in these countries .
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
At Tampere , we must agree future policy guidelines for co-operation , commit to certain jointly agreed concrete action , and ensure that restrictions imposed by the <unk> do not constitute a barrier to the effective action we wish to see .
With this in mind , the European Union has <unk> legislation in the field of environmental protection and has also been a key partner in international negotiations and agreements on the global protection of the planet .
Later , this House will be hearing from the President designate of the next Commission , José <unk> <unk> Barroso , and together we want to wish the new President every success .
I should simply like to show you the proposals here , so that you can see what huge proportions the technical legislation - just for buses with more than eight seats - has assumed .
As you know , this House did not create any difficulties when it was a matter of applying for urgent assistance for this area .
Some speakers have also referred to the need to continue this communication policy with which I totally agree .
First of all , let me say that the first duty of any budget authority - and in particular community budget authorities - must be that of as efficient and effective a policy on spending as possible .
I am also pleased that you , as rapporteur , recommend approval of the proposal .
The second message is that the European Union , as such , cannot deal with common immigration and asylum policies unless the agreements which the Member States adopt , either in interesting meetings such as the one that took place in La <unk> , which may lead to the beginning of strengthened cooperation in this field , or in the meetings of the Council of Ministers , are not then reflected in cooperative policies which lead to the burdens and responsibilities being shared , both from an economic point of view , and in terms of human and material resources .
I shall restrict myself to four remarks .
– Mr President , I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on this important piece of work .
Meeting the Stability Pact requirements , whilst providing the necessary funding for health , welfare and social services , is a major challenge .
First part Madam President , I am going to respond to some of the speeches made in this debate , while my colleague , Mrs Reding , will deal with issues relating specifically to cultural diversity .
It is also important to send a delegation to Cambodia to assess the situation .
In Gothenburg , however , the Union had taken a big step in that direction by announcing its desire to measure sustainable development through the Spring Council meetings .
The truth is that I would like it if Mr <unk> <unk> did not always bring up national concerns in this Parliament and if he could make contributions to European integration , which is why I believe we are all here .
In addition , I am still not convinced that phasing out is justified , given the possible harm this may cause .
The focus of this report and one of the main issues in this debate must be equality of access .
It must be fully integrated in the transport chain and be offered through <unk> shops .
They are after all more subtle and sophisticated .
The Commission cannot accept Amendment : 7 .
The adoption of this regulation will show that the European Union is not closing its borders , and is not setting up inhuman conditions along its external borders .
To be frank , I was hoping for some kind of explanation , some kind of justification , perhaps even some kind of argument that would help us to find the right way round this impasse .
As has been shown in a large number of studies , the rules of origin are a necessary condition for access to trade preferences .
On the one hand , enlargement must not lead to a new division of Europe .
The big difference is that Parliament has had the courage to say that it condemns this coup , and secondly that it not only supports <unk> but the embargo too .
I should like to recall the facts : the waiver of Mr Le Pen &apos;s immunity has been requested on five or six occasions in this session of Parliament and , in fact , on several occasions Parliament has decided that the case did not merit his immunity being waived .
As with all agreements of this type , I would remind you again that no amendments may be tabled .
Of course , we support the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General , Kofi Annan , but I hope those efforts do not end up being the victim of friendly fire .
The Irish people must show some <unk> on this issue .
I would however like to ask you as a matter of urgency to move things on as quickly as possible , so as to guarantee full compliance with the rules governing international trade .
I find the rapporteur &apos;s suggestion that that is what should happen if his position is not accepted most undemocratic .
I fear that this lesson has not been learnt in Brussels , given the <unk> with which reference is made to the <unk> of national politics , the absolute lack of self-criticism and the <unk> to continue the ratification process .
This is an important step forward .
Mr President , I want to begin by thanking my colleague , Mrs <unk> for the sterling work she has done on this report .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
It is a huge issue .
Something that would undoubtedly help Argentina is deeper integration of the Mercosur countries and the European Union is making an effort to accelerate its negotiations with Mercosur .
By extending the sphere of operations of private bodies , we will be moving towards a reduction of national assistance or even its total disappearance , which could prove extremely dangerous for the future .
Without going into too much detail , I would simply like to say that we have taken note of the objectives announced by the Spanish Presidency and that the EIB is at the Council and Commission &apos; s disposal , if it is felt , given the extent of our activities in the Mediterranean , that the EIB can help to achieve these objectives .
Since the introduction , Parliament and the Council have <unk> a lot of work .
Let us not enter into discussion .
You spoke in favour of the principle of subsidiarity ; as my time is limited , I will not enlarge on this point but I would like to mention again the young woman Mr <unk> spoke of this morning , <unk> <unk> in <unk> , who said : ‘ I believe in the future of Europe ’ .
These crimes are committed solely for the sake of pleasure and are treated with widespread indifference by a society which accepts prostitution as the <unk> profession in the world .
I congratulate him on a very balanced and informative report , notwithstanding the slightly odd decision to link these two topics – hedge funds and derivatives – in a single report , as trade in derivatives is already far more regulated in the EU than the area of hedge funds .
All these comments will be transmitted to the relevant authorities .
<unk> and immigration , and policies on tackling crime and terrorism , are of crucial concern to cities .
This does not mean that taxes should be harmonised .
The cosmetics industry is about marketing <unk> , <unk> and illusions and I am not as critical as some previous speakers about this .
I would ask that the resolutions we adopt should , in so far as they relate to Africa , be addressed to the <unk> Parliament as well .
<unk> taking part in the project as what amounts to a <unk> &apos; , cannot be considered to be sufficient ; So , I propose that this recommendation is included on the agenda for tomorrow .
They have since obtained political independence : the Latin American countries almost two centuries ago now , and the South Asian and African countries half a century ago .
The Council ’ s proposal to reduce payment appropriations for EU structural funds for 2006 by 150 million euro is incomprehensible .
This is a major achievement .
I cannot say anything about German hooligans but I can talk about English football hooligans - I cannot say <unk> &apos; and even the word <unk> &apos; is not strong enough for them .
However , in my opinion , and on the basis of my understanding of politics , this is unacceptable .
He was arrested at <unk> <unk> <unk> without charges .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to return to the Spring Summit .
Culture is <unk> and language is <unk> .
All decision-makers , both male and female , must be appropriately trained at Community level , not only as far as the <unk> factors &apos; are concerned , but also in the new areas of development cooperation which are becoming increasingly important : human rights , democratisation , the rule of law , participation of the civil society , good governance , trade , macroeconomic analyses , satisfying basic human needs , combating poverty , reproductive health .
We were all unanimous on the subject of developing this area , and adhering to a tight schedule .
Under this directive , children who are <unk> with a relative who is a permanent legal <unk> in the countries of the Union will have the right to full education under the same terms as the children of the citizens of the Member States .
This effort is being sat upon by a gigantic <unk> effort - which has obviously been <unk> over the years - that will not allow the flagship of fish-farming activities which is salmon farming to get off the ground .
Mr President , the Commission takes the view that the progress of the Peace and Reconciliation Programme for Northern Ireland has been satisfactory .
The Commission is quite satisfied , and we endorse the declaration by Parliament and the Council that some adverse effects could possibly result from the introduction of these devices .
It is clearly this which has given rise to <unk> between the Commission and Parliament .
There is some unease for instance in the electricity sector , and in the gas sector as well , that although we provide networks which in theory can work in two directions , all too often they only operate in one direction .
Responsibility for the arms trade currently rests with Member States , but the Commission is fully associated with its consideration under the common foreign and security policy .
But if we are talking about quality of service and citizen equality as regards pricing , in whatever geographic area where the service is provided , including peripheral or island regions , if we are talking about the employment of hundreds of thousands of workers in this sector , then in these essential areas the future is not guaranteed , not for more than a few years , at all events .
All this would encourage them to step up their dialogue with their European parliamentarians .
Some people dismiss this as an issue but I think it is very important .
This report on women ’ s rights in Turkey points out that women constitute only <unk> % of the Turkish parliament .
For example , I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component , namely refugees .
Then that will be explicitly recorded .
Mr President , last night I had a dream , probably <unk> by the fact that it was <unk> &apos;s Day yesterday .
I hope the Minister would agree with that .
That will be the normal period within which Member States will be expected to comply with the requirements of this directive in relation to junior doctors .
Mr President , I would concur with Mr Eurlings ’ final remarks .
It is imperative , therefore , that Iraq ’ s political , ethnic and religious leaders do all they can to address these issues .
And throughout the Mediterranean the idea has been created , justified or not , that Israel , or the Israeli government , is operating on the basis of total international impunity .
We must not allow the action of a few <unk> elements to frustrate these efforts .
That reflects very well on our Europe .
We are appealing for exactly the same kind of treatment .
That is why I am delighted with this resolution .
Madam President , I am very pleased to be taking part in this joint debate on three <unk> REX Committee topics : <unk> from our colleague , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , the textile sector from Mr Moniz and , of course , the World Trade Organization from Mr Kittelmann , which is the report I will be referring to principally .
Similarly , just as we agreed to discuss the French initiative , in which security features very <unk> , the Commission has already initiated a discussion in the Council on a proposal for a communication on a European asylum system and a communication on legal immigration , in other words , on the rights and duties of third-country nationals who are allowed to enter the Union legally .
We are doing so because we recognise the special situation faced by the outermost regions , and we accept their need for Community support .
We would like the Commission to report on this promptly .
We have modified it profoundly .
We therefore do not have a voting list and we will be voting on something we cannot see .
It has to be done and we are being told that the EU has to do it .
I otherwise hope that the open talk of the debate about religion , culture and politics is not <unk> by <unk> in paragraph 3 , as that is a paragraph that could simply bring this discussion to a tremendously good end .
I regret that the Council should have turned down the means for relaunching growth and employment .
We are proposing a political level for the current Member States which choose to make a great leap forward in this sector , and a second , economic level for the fifteen current Member States and the new members .
Greater efficiency within the Commission and more effective policy management over the life of the current financial perspective will give more confidence to the European citizens that their taxes are being put to good use and is the only way to ensure that the EU can achieve the wider goals of consolidation within its boundaries after the Nice summit and the gradual enlargement of the EU to the east .
In spite of investment in economic and social cohesion through the structural funds , the cohesion fund , the social fund etc . , the injustices largely remain in Europe between the poor and the rich , between those who do and those who do not have work , and between the strong and the weak regions .
Parliament has made its suggestions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission &apos;s proposal for a regulation shows that the obsession to make everything uniform with no regard for subsidiarity will affect those on the lowest incomes .
<unk> policy is clearly dominant ahead of the Stockholm Summit .
Commissioner Liikanen , by the year 2003 we shall probably have 1.7 million job vacancies in the information society in Europe which cannot be filled , and I believe that this in itself makes it essential that we devote the utmost attention to the question of digital content .
Clearly one has to strengthen the administrative capacity and the judiciary in order not only to adopt but also to implement the acquis .
Here I would stress the importance of neutral non-governmental organisations operating on the ground .
The Stockholm Conference has provided <unk> and terrible data .
The same holds true for other countries in the euro zone .
What was decided about EMU and a single currency at Maastricht was not set in concrete .
In fact this regulation could be supported today without further discussion since it is in line with our requests and expectations .
The Commission ’ s draft on statutory audits is the result of many years of preparation and incorporates recommendations made in 2000 and 2002 .
I myself had the honour - and Dr Mombaur was kind enough to say so - to be in the Chair at that Madrid Conference to which Mrs McNally referred , and to submit months later , in October 1994 , a motion for a resolution for Parliament to give its views on this aspect and ask the Commission to do the same .
Maybe we do not have enough journalists with a scientific background able to <unk> issues like risk or possibly , as I suspect , a <unk> front page headline which will sell a newspaper is more important than giving consumers information on which to judge their buying decisions .
The introduction of a lifetime limit for manufacturers for submitting the additional data requested by the Member States is a good idea .
Some very important aspects have been included , as many other people have mentioned .
We must equip schools but we must also have electronic communication centres in our local authority areas , because it is not only those who go to school who have to participate in the information society .
So I gave you extra time to <unk> you .
The Fund is a single instrument intended to integrate the three facets of European policy on refugees : the reception , integration and repatriation of refugees and displaced persons .
I would also like to take the opportunity to say something about UCLAF &apos;s role and functions .
It is <unk> that the European Union recognises the problems and is willing to focus on them .
The nature of the conditions that have been imposed for the Ukraine plan serve only to speed up the creation of infrastructures to receive foreign capital and goods , as is clearly spelled out in the report .
As Parliament has emphasised , the <unk> system has had great success in the area of agriculture .
In view of the fact that to talk of the &quot; Presidency of the Union &apos; is inappropriate and both constitutes a <unk> of the terms of the Treaties and <unk> the general public , can the Council say what steps it intends to take to ensure that speeches by the Presidency and official statements and documents stop talking about the &quot; Presidency of the Union &apos; and refer simply to the &quot; Presidency of the Council &apos; ?
As regards foreign policy measures , the Commission is proposing to enter into commitments worth almost EUR 5 billion , which is in line with 2003 levels .
As yet , the ECB has still not provided an explanation as to why price stability is more strictly defined in the euro area than in the US , and why it does not provide greater protection for the <unk> European growth process .
I am a little out of breath .
Mr Solana and I were directly involved in mediation at the time the force went in , as Parliament knows .
The solution that has now been found is a very good one .
These issues I presume will all be discussed in the UN Commission , and they will be something for legal specialists to get their <unk> into .
I expect the Member States of the EU , sitting , as they do , on this high-level UN body , to insist on reminding China and Russia of their crucial responsibility in this .
Indeed it was also France that come up with the idea of saving energy during the oil crisis .
– Thank you Mr President .
While there is a special relationship between Azerbaijan and Turkey , this is far from being the case for Armenia , a country against which Turkey is maintaining a commercial blockade , which is not acceptable in a country which has been accepted as a candidate for membership of the European Union .
Either this is a legal proposal from the committee and we can vote on this basis or this is not a legal proposal , in which case you are asking for one to be drawn up .
We are looking forward both to the positive implementation of these decisions and to really being able to bring peace and stability to this region of <unk> Europe , especially in the wake of incidents such as today &apos;s tragic incident .
More than 300 years ago , the British <unk> , John <unk> , introduced a fundamental idea : a government should be regarded as a tool for the defence of fundamental rights , the most fundamental civil right being the right to life and physical safety .
For months , a number of chemical companies have tried to <unk> a measure that has been necessary for the environment and public health for a long time .
Thirdly , the external aspects of the regime require especially careful handling .
We can really ensure that children grow up in a calm environment .
Whilst I welcome the aid package which has been proposed by the Commission , assistance has only been extended to farmers and the slaughter industry .
I will attempt to summarise and comment on your <unk> and questions .
Here , the Member States of the European Union must have the courage to stop exporting arms to governments that <unk> human rights under foot , such as the exports to Indonesia and to Turkey .
Recent Marshall Fund of Germany polls in Turkey have shown it to be the most <unk> and <unk> country amongst EU and candidate countries ; but more worrying in my view is large Turkish support for <unk> Iran .
With regard to the other amendments , I must emphasize very strongly that the Commission shares the concern expressed by the committee about the specific risks related to the <unk> of radioactive materials by sea , as well as the weakness of the notification system set up by the 1993 Directive .
This condition of <unk> is essential since , in my opinion , the principle of <unk> <unk> sine <unk> , legality in criminal law , must be observed .
I would argue that it is more essential , now that we have a strong public service broadcasting sector , to ensure the maintenance of that democratic , social and cultural sector .
The Interinstitutional Agreement can therefore be adopted tomorrow in any case .
By integrating Cyprus into the European Union , the outermost point of Europe and its Mediterranean dimension have now been covered .
None of these things can be achieved with what we have here , and I deeply regret that .
Your rapporteurs have said that this fifth enlargement , Mr President , is a great opportunity for Europe .
My question , therefore , is : can the Council confirm that the Commission has no <unk> in its readiness to accept new countries ?
The social impact of the widespread distribution of GMOs has been clearly identified : producers and consumers will become ever more dependent on the <unk> in the food processing sector .
In order to achieve this more free and more democratic Europe , Mr President , those who value the freedom of their countries , those who value their national democracy , and therefore those who value the true Europe should unite to defend their values .
Proposal for a Council Regulation on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector ( <unk> version ) ( COM ( 98 ) <unk> - <unk> / <unk> / <unk> ( CNS ) ) ( Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights ) We feel that the issue of employees &apos; inventions should be settled by the Member States themselves .
Often , unfortunately , their victims were forgotten and left alone .
As we see it , this is the only way to improve efficiency and access to these programmes by European citizens and companies .
I believe that doing so is a way of respecting Parliament and I acknowledge the strength of a number of arguments , which will enable me , I might add , to better devise an overall port policy for Europe .
There are so many questions that the debate about a centre is just a <unk> .
The petitions reaching the Committee give us an insight into citizens &apos; problems ; for example , they have in the past often brought us face to face with important problems , concerning in particular the environment and freedom of movement .
Accession to the EU represents a major opportunity for Turkey , as there is still a need for the values it represents , such as the rule of law , democracy and human rights , to gain acceptance there .
During the conference , all the speakers spoke unanimously in favour of the <unk> of this Regulation , which is somewhat unusual for expert opinions .
I would like to give two examples .
Nevertheless , in this highly technical policy proposal , they did not want to create the impression , by voting against , that they back the problems surrounding the synthetic drug .
– Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , a Greek friend who recently visited <unk> told me that what had impressed him most was that the police on the streets of Amsterdam gave the impression that they were there to protect citizens and their diversity , not to watch and suspect them .
The Turkish police and army are not serving the interests of the Turkish Government in their excessive use of force against <unk> in Diyarbakir and other towns .
The Member States made a big mistake in keeping the defence industry out of the single market , at Amsterdam as well .
– Mr President , I should like to return to what our fellow Member said regarding Mr Prodi ’ s <unk> remarks of a few days ago .
The real issue which is hidden behind the Europe of defence is actually access to nuclear weapons or , failing this , the removal in the long term of the French nuclear deterrent which , as everyone knows , exists when it is not shared .
The list is to be drawn up on the basis of the latest scientific findings , revised on a regular basis and updated where necessary .
Mr President , the Helsinki resolutions give an excellent definition of what sustainability means in relation to forestry .
( The session was suspended from <unk> p. m. until 6 p. m . ) Similarly , the new definitions of the terms <unk> concentration &apos; and <unk> concentration &apos; and the corresponding references are acceptable .
Finally , I congratulate the Italian Government and its Prime Minister , Mr Berlusconi , and the Belgian Prime Minister for having reached that important agreement yesterday on the European arrest warrant .
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is <unk> , that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it .
Has the Commission assessed what impact the US tariffs will have on jobs in the steel industry in Europe ?
This can take place in a whole variety of areas : whether there is a failure to transpose , or whether something takes place as a result of improper procedures .
As I mentioned before , I would be delighted to be invited to <unk> to discuss this item .
The request is completely unexpected .
By way of example , I would like to mention the pension fund directive on company pensions .
I wish they would be honest enough to recognise that there are at least some benefits .
Yesterday we reached agreement in <unk> on Socrates and Leonardo and on the youth exchange programme , on which Parliament will be delivering its opinion .
All of this can assist the creation of innovative projects , by and for young people , and encourage young people &apos;s spirit of enterprise .
Being secure also implies knowing that you can assert your rights by having recourse to justice .
All of us in this Chamber know that the position of men and women is very different in employment , in education , in the family , in society , not because one sex is worth less than the other , but because society remains fundamentally <unk> and thus <unk> discriminates against women .
Up to now I have received no answer , and I am beginning to think , to be convinced , almost , that we go to a lot of trouble to pass resolutions here , but do not know if they ever reach the recipients .
Can the Commission confirm the publication date of its communication on the Third <unk> Safety Action Plan ?
It is well known that large corporations tend to shed jobs when times are hard .
For one thing , there is increasing concern - and that is undoubtedly true - on the part of experts too .
And what is the regime in North Korea doing ?
In my country , for example , the law now makes provision for this scenario , and there is normally a requirement , but obviously it needs to become the norm .
At the moment , 90 % of payments take place within the Member States .
Mr President , given the threats once again faced by the people of <unk> <unk> , when they still have <unk> memories of the horror and barbarity they have suffered at the hands of the <unk> , we cannot content ourselves with simply condemning the events which are <unk> .
In any case , and in conclusion , Mr President , Madam rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission shares your point of view .
Contrary to the Commission &apos;s assertion that most causes of global inequality are <unk> to globalisation , the widening gap between the rich and the poor has developed precisely because unregulated markets and free capital mobility have <unk> to favour the countries , companies and individuals most able to harness these forces for their own benefit , at the expense of those with fewer resources or less political and economic influence .
It should be possible to take certain risks , otherwise there would never be any progress .
The fact that we had , all in all , 1 400 such sectors to monitor made that an immense task ; it is a communal effort by the Commission as a whole , one that , in recent months , had required many hundreds of staff , but I will also claim that this work is very substantial and that the sort of overview we have was never possible at the time of any previous enlargements .
At least these advances were regular .
Europe can now justify itself in the world as a partner with a forceful instrument of international sovereignty .
I must say that I deplore the lack of commitment among our ministers .
Finally , I come to compulsory <unk> : I have to <unk> my finger at my old friend Mr Martin here .
Indeed , the Council , emanating from the Member States , has a more accurate perception of the real , practical issues associated with the problems of accepting refugees , whereas the Commission is likely to have a more <unk> &apos; view , more remote from practical problems and real life in each of the Member States faced with an influx of refugees .
This is an issue which has greatly concerned this Parliament through the years .
Does it not consider it <unk> , and indeed necessary , to redirect the financial resources now allocated to the promotion of nuclear research , including research into nuclear fusion , into the promotion of renewable energy ?
If we use the deaths in the <unk> <unk> tunnel , which , of course , we all deplore , as a pretext for saying that we must not reopen the <unk> <unk> tunnel , then we should also close the <unk> tunnel , the <unk> tunnel and the Brenner <unk> .
Since we are to vote on this sensitive issue this week , it would be very good – a helpful <unk> – for us MEPs if we knew the thoughts of the citizens of this continent .
Despite these recent differences on human rights , I hope you will agree that European policy towards China , as <unk> by the Commission communication and Mr <unk> &apos;s report , has progressed significantly in a positive direction in recent years .
We therefore feel that the joint declarations by the European Parliament and Commission should be replaced by a much closer and stronger interinstitutional dialogue , involving a <unk> examination of the legislative programme by the Conference of Presidents .
More use can and should be made of the resources that the European Union makes available – in the shape of the Structural Fund , URBAN , LEADER , INTERREG and so on – in the service of cultural heritage , but responsibility for this lies with the Member States , and it is they that need to be made aware of the fact that investments in cultural heritage have beneficial effects on the quality of life in the regions and , of course , on tourism .
We decided , as late as this year , to provide this <unk> assistance of up to EUR 300 million in the form , in this case too , both of loans and of contributions .
The debate is closed .
It seems to me that this agreement should therefore be seen by Israel and by its recently elected government as another important dividend of the peace process and as further encouragement from the European Union to pursue the path it has <unk> taken towards developing good relations with neighbouring countries .
We find ourselves greatly influenced too by the ongoing tensions generated by the social crisis afflicting Europe , which can take the form of the <unk> human tragedy caused by unemployment or of exclusion and urban violence .
This is why we need to look at the <unk> proposals .
These are shortcomings that became apparent during the previous elections .
The Commission intends to continue its activity through the second phase of the European programme on climate change .
<unk> on both sides have gained control there .
I shall listen to your supplementary questions with interest .
It really is not good enough .
Furthermore , Mr <unk> says that he is speaking on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure .
The Fundamental Rights of the European Union , Mr President - and now we will have to see how we can include this Charter in the Treaty - also have another side .
It is a coherent agenda which I had occasion to propose last year with the study <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos; &#91; A European sword &#93; .
This is a lesson for our committee on other dossiers too .
However , it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations .
Secondly , last year we voted on a similar amendment .
I should like to call for a number of things .
Hundreds of prisoners of conscience , who are <unk> up in intolerable conditions , must be released .
We know that one of the approaches taken at Laeken will be horse trading - you can appoint the Chair of the Convention if I can choose the site of the Authority , and you can have the Police College - but I feel , rather , that all these decisions need to be taken on the basis of certain criteria which are strictly related to the interests of the institution we are attempting to create .
What is in danger , though , is the European social model , the social market economy .
How will the European Union deal with the regions that have legislative powers but cannot intervene in matters that are regulated at European level and are nonetheless of vital importance to them ?
The first is the unification of the two present systems ; the second is the absolute ban on <unk> olive oil with other <unk> oils .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your reply .
There are two ways of handling budgets .
The answers to the last question are obvious : as yet , not all the Member States of the European Union have the euro as their common currency ; that <unk> the internal market .
The first point of this <unk> is extension and enlargement .
Accordingly , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe tabled Amendment 3 .

The European Union could undertake the task of taking the case to other regions where the drug is grown .
Madam Fontaine promised that a note would be circulated explaining the current situation .
The current picture is also fragmented in terms of scope or area of application .
More than 50 % of all goods imported into the European Union are subject to what are known as preferential tariff arrangements .
I firmly believe that the quality of our lives in the future will depend on the fulfilment of this essential principle .
There is extra money for education in the field of the Internet , the electronic <unk> and there is more attention paid to the environment and much attention to safe living and to social conditions and within this we should not neglect a sound policy on the proper use of food and undoubtedly on milk as well .
There was talk of security , the term border control was introduced into this field and , listening to you , it appears that illegal immigration has to do with lack of security .
The problem now is that at the same time we are negotiating with the Council about an increase in funding .
Have torture and the death penalty been abolished ?
This is no surprise as it is a repressive regime which shows no tolerance for political competition .
In a word , there is progress everywhere .
The <unk> cautious nature of Article 129 of the Treaty , concerning health , recommends certain actions which underpin the approach of the Member States .
The Commission is working on a draft action plan on EU crime statistics .
.
Secondly , although Parliament may have its arguments with the Commission from time to time , we do have a much better chance of exercising democratic supervision if the Commission has the implementing powers than if the Council has them .
The manipulation of nature must be approached in a more careful way than that which Mr Purvis is proposing .
Terrorism mainly affects countries with colonial foreign policies .
But the Commission must take up the <unk> with those Heads of State or Government , with those ministers and councils of ministers , that are not willing to pay the price on Monday for the speeches they made on Sunday .
What is reasonable is to approve the financial perspectives now , working on the basis of the Luxembourg presidency , and accept a review clause during the period of those financial perspectives … And the only area in which you have promoted more Europe is in penalties and <unk> for the poor countries that are the origin of immigration .
We think it is much more reasonable that the Commission &apos; s obligation should refer to the whole year and that we should be allowed greater room for manoeuvre between 15 September and 31 December to present these reports .
<unk> must be <unk> out and organised crime combated .
We were sceptical about the signing of the <unk> peace agreement , which showed every sign of having been dictated by the former colonial power .
Madam President , for too long Europe has been dominated by the politics of fear : fear of globalisation , of immigration and of a race to the bottom .
How is the Commission preparing for EU enlargement in terms of the promotion of minority languages , and what part do linguistic minorities whose languages are majority languages in other Member States play in the discussions ?
I do not want to reflect on what might have been .
Another important issue for the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs is what we expect of immigrants , by which I mean their willingness to integrate and to recognise the Community of values .
It is important that there should be no <unk> in the absence of <unk> .
Indeed , with the establishment of the EU-China Dialogue on Human Rights , an important vehicle has been created in which both sides can exchange opinions and develop projects aimed at fostering tangible improvements .
The person concerned must be able to <unk> a complaint against this decision .
The importance of retaining the financial prospects instrument is stressed , and of entering into a new interinstitutional agreement .
To a certain extent , it is the human condition that is at stake in that great country .
Unfortunately , many Western press reports from that country have done nothing to clarify the situation but have confined themselves to laying the blame on President <unk> and his Government .
The solution put forward with the amendments , which we urge Parliament to adopt en bloc , is a compromise solution , but I feel that it is a useful , appropriate compromise in that it will allow us to move forward quickly with the creation of the .
<unk> domain .
It is necessary to be able to hold people to account in a democratic system governed by law , and the prerequisite for this is a common basis of values with clear guidelines .
It has placed a bomb in a <unk> and killed men , women and children .
This cannot be rational or <unk> , and we should like it to be investigated whether closer cooperation between Eurostat and the various national offices might , in the long term , render the Observatory &apos; s work superfluous .
Firstly , at the level of awareness , secondly , at the level of suppression , and thirdly , in the direction of protection and rehabilitation of victims .
Thirdly , extradition must not be allowed if the defendant is liable to be sentenced to the death penalty .
Against this background , the European People &apos;s Party will tomorrow vote for the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs , with the purely technical Amendment No 12 which was submitted by the Group to the House .
The joint resolution takes this approach and is a positive step which will have a <unk> effect and spread confidence in those markets most affected by the crisis .
That is unacceptable .
I give the floor to Sir Leon to answer Mr Howitt &apos;s question .
The rapporteur reminds us that there has been a strategy for mutual assistance in recovering claims since 1976 , but because of anomalies in implementation , recovery cannot be fully guaranteed for either legitimate creditors or the Community and its budget .
The objectives were ambitious .
Is there <unk> in charge ?
Various scenarios are being examined .
Mr President , I would first like to thank Mr <unk> for a balanced and reliable report on the European budget for 1999 .
Nonetheless , I should like briefly to outline them once again today on behalf of my group .
The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union .
Mr President , would you allow a question to the Commission , although it does not strictly speaking conform to the Rules of Procedure ?
It also forms a vital cornerstone of the strategy for sustainable development .
The direct aid will solve a lot of the problems we are talking about .
I refer to Amendments Nos 5 , 12 , 14 and 15 , the second part of Amendment No 20 and Amendments Nos 21 and 27 .
The ratio is similar in the majority of the new Member States .
I have spoken with the President of Parliament about his initiatives and I think he is in full agreement with this prospect .
All too often , we find that the Council follows its own line of thought and this is no longer the way in which we can market modern foreign policy which covers a wide range of issues .
By establishing clearly when and how the precautionary principle should be applied , it clarifies its use at a European level , making it more credible , and it mandates the European negotiators in the next round of the World Trade Organisation to <unk> the precautionary principle as basic and universal .
The third contradiction is a <unk> of the first two , demonstrating clearly how in practice these <unk> serve to weaken European solidarity , which is the principle underpinning economic and social cohesion .
Our Group is in favour of adopting it .
The BSE affair has shown the dangers to which we can be exposed when research is allowed to have high productivity as its sole focus in agriculture and pointed up the need to provide for a monitoring system that is genuinely independent of the economic and political powers .
An inspection plan from the competent authorities , which has been preceded by a risk analysis , should be sufficient .
The Commission has justified this measure by saying that the airlines did not want to have the burden of creating filters and therefore gave immediate access , as they were afraid of the EUR <unk> fine , amongst other things .
There are a number of EU-wide recommendations and agreements on immigration policy and these cover most - but not all - categories of migrant .
Even in those days it was not easy for young farmers to carry on the family farm or get started in the industry .
Women can make an important contribution to bringing about peace , <unk> child soldiers and creating political dialogue between the warring parties .
We need to look at our position as regards developing countries .
Secondly and in parallel , the Committee on the Rules of Procedure has declared itself in favour of Parliament &apos;s report making it clear that there would be NO obstacle placed in the way of Mr Ribeiro Campos appearing in court - although this would have to be in the capacity of a witness , without the slightest compromise to his rights - especially those rights he enjoys as a Member of this Parliament - and , of course , without any coercion .
Because at first reading the Commission brought forward a proposal comprising over 100 pages of detailed regulations , and during the first reading debate all the groups agreed to reject the directive for reasons of principle .
The positive aspect , however – as has already been mentioned – is the creation of the Peace <unk> Committee .
This will show that PVC <unk> and window frames , for example , or PVC water pipes are products which we want to use because of their characteristics .
Madam President , I believe that the European Union ’ s <unk> role is more necessary now than ever .
We must welcome this budget , it is the last easy budget , the last simple budget .
Particularly Amendments Nos 40 and 41 concern this topic .
To repeat , we are not going to have a debate here which ought to take place in committee .
Moreover , there must be strategic coordination of existing defence companies in various Member States , with the European Agency acting as one of the focal points for technological innovation and for <unk> the products and processes of European firms working in defence-related sectors .
After the unsuccessful referendum on the Constitutional Treaty , and without a common foreign and energy policy , let us at least expand the Euro zone and give the European Union renewed impetus for growth .
However , the systematic suppression of opposition elements , including a number of <unk> ? , the lack of democratic checks and balances and the treatment of the media have led us to freeze relations .
So is the <unk> report dealing with a <unk> ?
I should , however , like to draw attention to the article in last week ’ s with the headline : ‘ <unk> by <unk> as gangs target sites ’ .
This fishing would conflict greatly with the interests of the 100 000 or so artisanal fishermen who operate in this country and who have repeatedly <unk> to the European Union and to the local authorities about this .
The European Union is a union of states and peoples and the success of the Union as an economic and political entity is <unk> on the fact that both smaller and larger Member States are treated in many respects as equal partners within the Union .

Among other things , the Security Council has demanded that Iraq give the UN weapons inspectors unconditional and <unk> access and ensure that the country &apos;s authorities cooperate to the extent required .
The next item is the joint debate on the following four reports , drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism : The Council has not discussed the matter to which the honourable member refers .
Recently , too , I would also add , we have concluded an interinstitutional agreement laying the foundations for ‘ better <unk> ’ in the European Union .
British Conservatives support the objectives behind the Sustainable Development Strategy but believe that this resolution is unduly negative as to the progress that is being made .
We shall therefore act in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , as usual .
I am able to assure you that the Commission , in close consultation with the EU &apos;s Member States , is following further developments in Cambodia with close attention .
I also take the view that it is only this tension between the various committees that makes it possible for something sensible to emerge at the end of the day .
If consumers wish to purchase food derived from animals which were not fed on GM feed , then they can do so via the organic route .
My impression is that absolutely nothing has been done .
Secondly , the rapporteur is completely right in putting his finger on the <unk> point of supervision by national governments of the conduct of their own arms dealers .
Because big business calls the <unk> , because major <unk> are involved , because the mass media are backed by strong centres of power and because , in my view , intervention by the European Union is inadequate and misguided .
This <unk> attitude cannot prevail if we are trying to be serious about how we manage the Union &apos;s budget and the taxpayers &apos; expenses in the future .
<unk> about food safety is unfortunately far too recent a development in Europe , emerging as it did at the time of the BSE crisis .
Since many developing countries are entirely <unk> on cotton production , EU aid <unk> the competition .
No European city is without refugees , primarily women , who have been illegally <unk> for the purpose of prostitution .
We will need to deal with this at <unk> today .
What has to be decisive is that the decision-making structure should be more efficient than that proposed in Nice , and should enable an enlarged Community to act ; that has to be the crucial <unk> , and I believe that , if we take this as our basis and apply the requisite capacity for imagination , we will be able to find compromises that will enable this to be accepted by those countries that often have difficulties on this point , for it is connected – or can be – with other issues as a means towards reaching a compromise that , while being truly fair , does justice to the three goals of democratisation , transparency and efficiency .
In view of the commitment and quality of the Green Paper on emissions trading , the communication on policies and measures , the communication <unk> a European climate change programme &apos; is a disappointment .
I am critical of a number of other points .
Thirdly , the consequences for trading partners must not be inequitable , and no unnecessary trade barriers should be erected , particularly for developing countries .
The Convention on the Law of the Sea is , however , a very important agreement to save the marine environment and an opportunity for countries in the third world to assert their right to the sea on the same terms as the rich countries .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am sorry that our last transport policy debate before the elections is taking place in such unsatisfactory circumstances .
That cannot be allowed to continue , but neither can the historic reasons for causing it to happen .
They are a way of helping people escape drug dependency .
So to tell me that enlargement is going to be financed by a reduction in the structural funds is quite simply wrong .
Parliament &apos;s report proposes that payments should be extended to cover the period <unk> .
As an example of this attitude we might recall their recent reaction to the motion for a resolution on North Korea submitted by the European Union to the UN General Assembly last year .
This must be closed , but not exclusively by means of the measures now on the table .
This <unk> situation reflects one of the <unk> features of Mr Evans &apos; s report , which is otherwise full of engaging features .
The <unk> of new feed quantities creates new problems on the meat market and new control problems .
Consequently , we should not beat our <unk> in self-criticism and say that we should do more , but compare ourselves to others and draw attention to how much aid they provide .
I welcome the recent statement of the Regional Affairs Commissioner , Mrs <unk> , when she stated that adequate funds must remain for continuing special support to the present four cohesion countries , namely Spain , Portugal , Greece and my own country of Ireland during the next structural funds round .
If the pollution becomes just a little worse , cars will only be allowed on the roads in Paris every other day .
We have to realise that SMEs could be the only real job machine in the Union .
The Protocol on asylum policy includes an Article which means essentially that an EU citizen is prevented from receiving asylum in another EU State .
I think it is extremely important that this Parliament send a message to the future Parliament - the Parliament which will be elected in 1999 - a message that there must necessarily be innovations to the institutions .
That said , our dock workers in Marseilles , <unk> and other large ports will be handed over to the <unk> of <unk> .
I should like to ask the Commission how this is done at the moment .
We call on the <unk> to resume dialogue with the EU before the Board of <unk> of the <unk> next meet , in November .
What nonsense is this ?
<unk> wisdom recognised that man was always tempted by excesses resulting in violence .
I therefore welcome the questions because they give me the first opportunity since last Wednesday &apos;s General Affairs Council to focus explicitly and publicly on those matters .
I am therefore grateful to you for having stated clearly that you believe we are making headway .
Instead , the EU &apos; s task is to limit its responsibilities and to focus upon its core areas of concern .
You must therefore promise us , Commissioner , to keep a very careful eye on the national competition authorities , and I can assure you that I shall keep an eye on you and make sure you live up to our expectations , something which you have , of course , done so far .
This will require sensitive and intensive management to absorb this change <unk> .
We therefore suggested that we should have some overall view of this and , for that purpose , on first reading , we put 500 staff into the reserve - the additional posts requested .
Commissioner , one of the seven measures that you proposed several months ago is today being proposed for implementation .
It is not relevant that the <unk> of the emissions , which do not just relate to these lorries , but also to lorries from third countries outside the European Union and private cars and Austrian cars and lorries <unk> within Austria , give a different result .
In two areas , however , crucial mistakes are being made , first of all when it comes to the very process of making criminal law into a supranational affair .
I would ask him to give this House this evening an assurance that he will use his undoubted influence to have the matter discussed at the summit in your country next week .
That is a particularly successful intellectual proposal .
The third is facing up to demographic change within the European Union .
They will select the pacts and they will inform the Commission .
First of all , this means that cofinancing is not the only conceivable solution , but it also means that we shall not table a proposal until there is a clear political will on the part of the Member States for us to do so .
Now we are almost there .
I therefore believe that we can state , with the frankness with which we have always dealt with our Israeli friends , that we will condemn terrorism a thousand times , as many times as necessary , and that we will have nothing to do with it .
Furthermore , <unk> petrol and environmental diesel will have to obey stricter criteria as from January 2000 .
If one looks at the dangers of cadmium one realises that we must seek out alternatives .
In general terms , vast amounts of energy are being wasted in the EU as a whole .
On the other hand , certain phenomena linked to migration may make an effective contribution to the development of countries of origin .
It would , of course , also be splendid if the Council could express a positive attitude today , for it would mean that , quickly and within the coming week , we could bring our reading of this directive to a close , something which I would call upon us to do .
These proposals will result in new burdens that are too much for a sector that has already been weakened by health crises , and which is awaiting the new CAP guidelines .
These questions are at the top of the agenda .
The dimension and complexity of the project is such that it required several exchanges of information between the Commission and the Spanish authorities in order to gather all the factual and legal information needed for the Commission to properly and duly investigate the case .
The document now states that the proposed package of limit values should be aligned , as far as possible , with developments in the United States so as to offer manufacturers a global market for their engine concepts .
Finally , Libya itself <unk> refugees outside its borders to dangerous regions .
There is more to do .
We hope he will manage to get the Member States to identify more with the Stability and Growth Pact and develop a greater sense of responsibility for it .
We are all bound by technical progress and technological advances , and from that point of view we have to trust in progress .
It is up to you , Members of the European Parliament , to continue to give them a guilty conscience , so that reforms are implemented at local , regional and national level .
This <unk> Indian came here as an envoy of his people , accompanied by the signs of his dignity , namely a small wooden <unk> measuring less than two metres .
To do that we need very clear and detailed rules , but there must be a level playing field across Europe , and in this case that means a harmonised and more effective method of testing .
It remains general and non-binding .
We are very satisfied that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy included issues of shipping and air traffic within the scope of this directive , and we are convinced that the benefits to be gained from adhering to an integrated strategy are enormous .
It is precisely the way in which they tie in with each other that gives the definition its coherence .
.
These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly .
We must demonstrate solidarity .
However , I share Mrs Ludford &apos; s doubts .
This is in the case where , for example , in social security regulations , age limits are used or definitions for people for whom derived rights exist , that are based on family law in the Member States .
Unfortunately , the situation is not so advantageous on all the internal borders because , even if the Community resources originate from a single fund , it only needs the procedures for administering the appropriations to be different on the two sides of the border to make it difficult to finance common projects in both border regions .
Lastly , I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Commission wants this proposal for a regulation to be implemented by the management committees in which the Council and the Commission are involved yet which Parliament is excluded from .
All this is quite positive .
In fact , the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control , under the leadership of their chairmen , <unk> Samland and <unk> Theato , have from the beginning used pressure and encouragement in support of the Commission &apos;s efforts for a new culture of financial management .
Let me stress that I believe the treatment of the agreement is working very well in this respect .
Mr President , this set of reports by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is highly significant and reveals the times we are living in , in terms of concepts and approaches .
I am therefore concerned about the constant complaints from various groups concerning the difficulties they face practising their religion in China .
In spite of these serious violations of the duty to remember and of the principles of democracy , Europe ’ s institutions are acting as though there were nothing wrong and are confirming that the die is cast : on 3 October 2005 , the European Union will begin accession negotiations with Ankara .
Without denying the disastrous effects on the world economy of the <unk> decisions of George Bush , what was at the heart of the proposals made in Porto Alegre against the war and in favour of peace were the serious political and humanitarian issues raised by the United States &apos; aggression .
I believe that all democrats in Europe and throughout the world today hope that impunity will cease .
We are developing all the elements of the action plan , not only the operational part , but also the legislative one , and in several areas that you have mentioned , such as asylum legislation , we have been adopting the necessary rules that were provided for by the Tampere programme .
The outcome of those petitions is detailed in the remarkable report by Mr Gutiérrez Díaz , who has produced a very readable account .
Having proposed the transfer of the full amount of 1 billion ECU to the 1998 budgetary year ( which would have led to an 8 % increase in structural actions !
) , the Commission has finally realised that the structural actions were already sufficiently <unk> in 1998 .
It demands immediate action .
Mr President , in the run-up to the G7 summit the Council adopted a new action programme to support the Russian Federation .
The Union has been a major user of these regional negotiations .
A number of initiatives and ideas have been put forward .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Gradin .
The Commission has produced a draft paper on risk capital and job creation in the European Union , analysing the venture capital market across the European Union in comparison with the United States and concluding with an action plan outlining further work required at both Member State and European level .
For example , small firms lack information about new ideas developed by universities and research institutes , the possibilities for technology transfer and , as I said earlier , access to assistance programmes .
The degree of protection we have now achieved with this directive is not perfect , of course , but is an initial step in the right direction .
The report highlights the fundamentally inadequate procedures for combating fraud and more importantly how slow the Commission was to react to clear evidence of major problems within Eurostat .
Will they get caught ?
The summit outcome is a success for the EU and it bears the ‘ made in Europe ’ stamp .
With my colleague , <unk> Carlotti , we received them and listened to them with the greatest attention , because some of them , or members of their families , have been <unk> ill treated and abused under the <unk> dictatorship .
That is the question that inevitably springs to mind when you read its policies for relaunching the Doha Round of the WTO international trade negotiations .
That brings me to the fourth stage , which is evaluation .
It is abundantly clear that if you wish to see your country retain its independence , you have to vote ‘ no ’ .
Is it true that , according to Eurobarometer surveys , 48 % of Europeans agree or strongly agree that GM is useful in food production for improved nutrition and for improving shelf life or taste , despite the emotive campaign by the Greens to convince them of the contrary ?
Such workers are of course an issue for accession countries .
There must be a strong commitment by all governments to ensure that equivalent telecommunications are provided in both urban and particularly rural areas .
My sole <unk> is the knowledge that , of all the Member States , Portugal is one of the best at implementing the Funds .
And only yesterday , even some ministers in the Israeli Government criticised the deaths of innocent civilians during the recent Israeli military operations in Gaza , one of the heaviest air strikes for months .
From this sum , my fellow citizens know that they receive a benefit in return of around 70 billion <unk> , 85 % of which is under the EAGGF Guarantee .
Madam President , yesterday in this House the chairperson of my delegation , <unk> Díez , reported another <unk> of a written answer from the Commission to a question in Question Time , before Parliament officially received the answer from the Commission .
I think it is also positive that the report <unk> the need to give adequate protection to victims and <unk> , to grant the victims of trafficking temporary rights of residence for the entire period of criminal investigation or trial , including providing adequate accommodation and other support , specifically for reintegration , and the creation of a database of missing persons .
The situation at the moment does not fill us with enthusiasm .
At the time , this also provoked all sorts of arguments and it was said that it was going to jeopardise security in airports .
The highest priority must be given by the industry throughout the European Union to the attainment of best practice in line with stringent environmental guidelines and high standards of quality assurance , as is currently the case in Ireland .
With regard to the date , this too has been chosen with a view to guaranteeing that this Summit is as productive as possible .
Mr <unk> , as a respected legal expert , you must acknowledge that the rules cannot be ignored in this way .
However - and the developing countries are right in this respect - we must demonstrate that it is possible to organise economic growth and prosperity without doing so at the expense of the environment .
I share Mr Howitt &apos;s concern that the existing laws do not <unk> down on the proceeds of crime .
I do hope that this Parliament , which has that responsibility , will undertake that in the course of the next 12 months .
<unk> can be imposed on these countries which can also serve to increase financing from the private sector .
To my knowledge , the United States have not yet given their opinion on the problem of the peace clause which takes us to 2003 ; we will clearly have to address the question of knowing what we will do after that .
At this point , I would like to express our particular thanks to the ladies and gentlemen of the Committee secretariat , to our staff and the staff in the Parliamentary groups .
You feel that we need a new <unk> <unk> here .
I am , of course , very happy that this question is on the agenda of the United Nations .
It is therefore a personal concern of mine that the outcome of the negotiations should be understood and accepted by the people .
The amendment was tabled , Mrs McCarthy .
Mr President , firstly I wish to congratulate Mr Tillich on his excellent presentation of the Commission &apos;s budget and thank both Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Fabra <unk> for the kind words introduced in the supplementary and amending budget .
We at least need a little more information on the Commission and the Council &apos;s intentions regarding the initiatives in Afghanistan and the Middle East .
Madam President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , I would very much like to conclude by handing over to my colleague <unk> Hoff .
But we should be happy to have come this far .
The compromise takes account of my amendment to this effect , which means that I can endorse the report with a clear conscience at this first reading .
I am assuming that the Commission and the ECOFIN Council will naturally be using all relevant sources as a basis for carrying out the task which they have been given .
His work is very constructive and he , together with the Russians , are making a variety of preparations to ensure their effective participation in the conference .
I think the Commission should submit a communication on how such a body could be set up , to open the debate with Parliament and Council .
And the German law on energy saving is clearly supported by the proposal for a directive .
The customer is still <unk> .
So I must insist that the following speakers keep to their speaking time .
Commissioner Fischler and I will therefore take this mandate as the basis for what we do .
<unk> together , these programmes are an impressive start to practical cooperation between the relevant specialists in all our Member States .
I quite rightly asked DG I to look at the report as it was voted in committee to see if it was legally <unk> in the way it set up and called for a committee of inquiry .
Moreover , the European Parliament has just issued its opinion on an agreement which is utterly <unk> in legal terms since it mentions an Article <unk> which is not even completed - and which obviously has yet to be ratified !
These state quite clearly that , through public participation , every citizen should be able to live in the environment he or she finds pleasant , yet this objective cannot actually be achieved , as everyone has a different way of looking at his or her environment .
In my opinion , we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems , also <unk> from American legislation , which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector .
They cannot all be wrong !
There are more limits - and I shall end on this point - since control is a single entity that we cannot <unk> or cut up into <unk> .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this is actually a very interesting report on a useful idea : the idea of granting aid to the less developed countries in order to enable them to abandon drug production in favour of alternative crops .
Whatever <unk> of humanitarian <unk> say , the operations carried out by the Russian forces in Chechen territory , and let us not forget that Chechnya is an integral part of the Russian Federation , are conducted by a regular army , under the authority of a democratically-elected president , and therefore concern the simple maintenance of law and order .
For all the reasons you have mentioned , in addition to all the others , we are already in favour of this request even though consensus is still required and some contracting parties are not so happy .
The monitoring system , for example , confirmation and notification of <unk> of dangerous substances , black <unk> at long last , monitoring of ships , the facility for Member States to intervene and prevent ships from <unk> when the conditions are too dangerous - these are all are important matters and we support them .
We have become quite accustomed to some people reacting by asking what it will it cost .
If so , why does Britain have lower quotas in the waters around our shores than some other countries from further <unk> ?
It is agreed by everyone that this is affordable and achievable if we can <unk> enough international political will to make significant progress .
In the developing countries there is a demand for cheap , adaptable , <unk> and <unk> labour .
It will identify the main economic , social and environmental challenges upon which our success will depend , and it will put forward priorities and solutions .
She has introduced the complaints addressed to the Ombudsman as a means of controlling Community law and its application .
Mr President , the subject of Kyoto has of course been discussed with the United States .
Such broadcasts will be the only source of independent information for <unk> .
One of the key issues is the ban on the direct advertising of breast implants to the public .
This is not a new subject .
I cannot defend Mr Solbes more than Mr Poettering , but at least I support him on this point .
Since you too , Mrs <unk> , referred to the hope that the vote will have a positive outcome , I would repeat that , as regards whether or not to decide on the vote – referring to the speech made before by Mrs <unk> – there will , if necessary , be a vote in plenary to decide whether or not to accept the <unk> of this vote .
The truth or otherwise of certain allegations needs to be verified quickly .
Of course , the practical implementation of this policy involves greater difficulties than its establishment .
These include eight reactors from the nuclear power stations at <unk> in Lithuania , <unk> in Bulgaria and <unk> in the Slovak Republic .
The Convention ’ s draft Constitution says – although of course it is not yet in force – that the results of the European Parliament elections will be taken into account when the Commission President is appointed .
None of these principles is satisfactorily enshrined in the text which came out of Amsterdam .
I have passed through them and I believe that wisdom suggests that if we can keep Serbian refugees in Serbia and <unk> in Croatia , that is the way it should be .
It was remarkable that the idea wrongly arose that admission was already agreed , so that all at once the impression was created that the policy might be harmful to press freedom in Croatia .
The situation of the various Member States as regards the services sector is extremely diverse : Portugal , for example , has enormous potential to create jobs in this field , especially intensive knowledge-based services to be supplied to businesses and other institutions , family support services and tourism and associated activities .
It was in fact raised by the Austrian Foreign Minister during the informal meeting of foreign ministers .
The Liberals support this reform , all the while stressing that the burden of taxation must not be increased .
We need to consider if we need new <unk> structures in the face of these revolutionary developments , new structures for listening to employees and making decisions .
It is probably horrendous , especially in this particular raft of legislation , that there are confused rules , regulatory <unk> and rules that only lay down <unk> legal concepts .
And when I visit the Balkan states , Latin America , <unk> or Central Asia , I hear the same thing – more Europe .
The same fundamental preconditions apply to Croatia too : cooperation with the International Court is a . <unk> all of this carries no weight .
It is a particular honour because this is the first time any parliament has officially considered , in depth , what is undoubtedly the most important multilateral agreement since the GATT round was completed .
<unk> account is taken of the need to guard commercial confidentiality .
It is essential to take into consideration the legitimate concerns of Israel with regard to the security of its citizens and to condemn and isolate terrorism .
You wish to amend this request , and to have a statement on the <unk> famine instead of the statement on Iraq - and , if I have understood correctly , this latter request is supported by Mr van Velzen , on behalf of the PPE Group - and to leave the debate on Turkey as originally scheduled .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for <unk> piloting this legislation through the three readings in this House and through the conciliation procedure .
We all know them very well .

I would add that that also applies to pledges from the EU Member States to the tune of EUR 1.5 billion .
I want to pick up on certain aspects where , for once - unlike last year &apos;s Spring <unk> we looked at issues relating to global <unk> to some extent .
<unk> are absolutely vital here and it would be fatal if Saddam Hussein <unk> the intentions of the West , of the European Union and of other allies and if he thought that he was able to create divisions among those allies .
Once again many thanks to the rapporteur .

.
We need to stop this so that consumers can benefit from the price reductions to farmers .
The question was raised of including compensation if the employee is made redundant .

Only a tiny proportion of waste should be destined for landfill , in conjunction with preventive measures to ensure that such waste does not harm people &apos;s health , the environment , or the <unk> .

Moreover , individual grants are to be awarded in recognition of excellence and on the basis of criteria defined by the scientists .

Secondly , I should also like to stress a point which has already been made by Mr Andersson : a follow-up procedure stands or falls on certain tests .
We concluded that in order to preserve subsidiarity it is important to reduce the appropriations for the axes , that is 10 , 20 and 8 .

The second job I have for you , or perhaps this is on your agenda anyway , is a tough one : the climate summit in Buenos Aires .

The success or failure of this directive will depend on the extent to which it is observed and complied with .
However , considering the importance of the work to be done , the necessary collection of information , reflection and consultation and assessment of possible measures , it would not be realistic to set the <unk> date of any comprehensive Commission proposal for a plan of action for <unk> within the time limit indicated in Amendment 8 .

That is the main message of the Amsterdam Treaty .

They do not include Lord <unk> because he is far too committed a European for that .
In addition , as regards the recommended simplification of using a <unk> code instead of the <unk> code for identifying certain goods , as in the <unk> System , the conditions needed in order to benefit from this simplification are being adopted by the Commission in comitology by taking into account a partnership between national administrations and users and by noting the vital importance of close cooperation with all the indicated parties being confirmed from the outset by a legislative text .
Mr President , this Parliament has always been concerned about the democratic deficit in the Community &apos;s decision-making process and the defence of proper rights of representation .
In other words , just as the name Arafat was and is connected with the Palestinian question , so the Öcalan case raises the unresolved problem of the Kurdish people .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a. m . However , if its work is to be satisfactory and efficient , it must be the central reference and coordination point for all the national surveillance centres and reference centres and laboratories of the Member States .
I am aware – and I am speaking here as a parliamentary rapporteur – that the compromise that has been reached may not meet with this House ’ s approval .

Madam President , I wish to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council and to wish him every success in the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union .

These people have a good lobby , and this has again done excellent work in endeavouring to create additional posts for the various Community institutions : the Committee of the Regions ; the Economic and Social Committee ; the Joint <unk> <unk> ; the Court of Auditors and the Court of Justice .
However , I have some concerns regarding the amount of legislation sought by this report and the move towards creating more bureaucracy and red tape , which could work to the detriment of the ideals underlying the social policy agenda .
For that reason , the new Directive contains provisions to guarantee that Member States can adopt measures to protect the right to information , and ensure wide public access to television coverage of national or <unk> events of major importance to society .
All these issues are covered by provisions in the draft decision .
I just want to address one point which the Socialists <unk> into the committee discussions but that really has no direct bearing on the report , namely paragraph 25 , which we must reject .
For example , people sometimes tell us that the cost of enlargement is too high .
This phenomenon falls under the heading of social and fiscal dumping , but the Commission , for all its high principles , does nothing to combat it .
We are engaged in politics and politics must have a sound basis .
.
Nonetheless , we have made some demands of the Commission to ensure that Parliament is able to follow the work on the regulation more effectively .
If we succeed in doing that , I think the European Parliament will have made no small contribution to promoting a vision of the world and of international relations which corresponds to the expectations of the citizens of Europe and the developing countries , who are right to look to Europe as a positive factor for fairness and development .
To give them rights ?
What is more , the planned solutions to assist these <unk> are problematic and harmful .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
A few months ago , we sat down together here and renewed our commitment to the Lisbon Process , at the heart of which – among other things – is a knowledge-based society in Europe .
In response to our questions , we received only inadequate information , for which we had to wait a long time .
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , of which I too am a member , knows exactly how sensitive and varied are the traditions in individual Member States ; the fact that it is precisely this committee that is approving this <unk> acquisition of competences by the back door , as it were , in an own-initiative report , is , I think , much to be regretted .
I see this - not only in view of what Commissioner Lamy said - as an important guide to the timeframe within which , in the aftermath of Doha , a <unk> of regional trade agreements around the world may perhaps come about .

What I got by way of a reply was a brief <unk> from a legal text .
I also think that greater attention must be paid to women &apos; s rights in connection with the cooperation that is going on with Mediterranean countries , as it is there that <unk> violations of human rights , particularly in respect of women , take place .

That said , we produce only 123 , 000 tonnes of honey .
Mr President , the estimate of agricultural expenditure is the largest expenditure item in the Union &apos;s budget .
This is what the other countries which have applied for membership ought to know .

I , too , was making the same point , and others have also emphasised it .
We particularly appreciate the commitments made by Arab countries .

In this context , Parliament has already had occasion to adopt proposed amendments to a number of directives addressing the technical improvement of engines and fuel quality .
More sacrifices have been made by that fleet than any other fleet in the European Union .
However , I would like to make a few comments concerning certain omissions , gaps and <unk> contained in the report .

On the eve of the beginning of the enlargement negotiations , the nightmare of a Balkan war is looming over us .

In the asylum sector , we want to push ahead with directives such as directives on refugees .
We have examined the proposals over the past 10 years and insisted on guarantees in a number of sensitive areas .
Instead an appeal should be made to the Commission President , with whom Luxembourg has good contacts , to provide her with more staff .
The Commission ’ s ability to honour its commitments for 2007 will depend largely on the outcome of talks between the Council and Parliament on proposed instruments for funding Community actions .
On this issue at least , we appeal to this House to abandon its tradition of not letting the facts stand in the way of political and economic convenience .

The stance adopted in Parliament by Commissioner Nielson on behalf of the Commission is , therefore , justified .

We conclude that whilst this report may have been <unk> , we cannot endorse the end result .

We must react , because impunity encourages arrogance .
The <unk> have produced a fantastic achievement .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p. m . That is , of course , a problem for Europe and , above all , for the countries around the Mediterranean .
The results of this first debate will be presented to the Council on 20 November .
We should therefore endorse and support the demand for a formal right of recall .
It is because the Heads of State and Government simply do not want it .
<unk> , Commissioner , until we in the rich world tackle the need for fairer and better access to our markets , there will be no prospect of a wider deal on industrial goods and services .
Therefore , again , the European Union has a role to play in pushing this forward in a positive way .
The reason why I asked this question is because I have been in contact with a number of eastern European environmental organizations which are very <unk> about the way the European Investment Bank has acted in certain projects in eastern Europe , that is , when environmental impact assessments are not carried out until after grants have been made to projects which are very suspect from an environmental point of view .

In very many countries , we currently have water <unk> pipes made from copper .
On this morning , when welfare benefits for disabled people are causing great public debate in my own country , the United Kingdom , I welcome our example of the new deal for disabled people which has sought to break down the barriers by providing personal advisers at the local level through what is known as a single <unk> to use flexibly both employment and social security budgets with unemployed disabled people to genuinely find the measures which will assist them into work .
We need clear criteria and transparent mechanisms so that this cannot happen again .
It is not acceptable that the <unk> between the pledges and promises made by the European Union on the one hand , and the reserved funding on the other hand , should be as huge as it is now threatening to become .
Thank you , Mrs Diamantopoulou .
It can only approve Member States &apos; proposals if they fulfil all the criteria : firstly , integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships , whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account ; secondly , the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local , regional and national authorities , training institutions , universities , NGOs , the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a <unk> partnership , and thirdly , methods and models of <unk> innovative character .
The Council knows that conditions in Egyptian prisons can be harsh .

Many of these changes have either not yet been implemented or have been implemented partially .

There is also the usage - and the Council should tell us what purpose they serve - of &quot; square <unk> &apos; which are <unk> to us .
Mr President .
When we talk about the <unk> zone , when we talk about the collateral damage , do not let us forget that point .
<unk> ways of ensuring that trade policy helps to resolve the poverty issue , however , is no easy task .
The vote will take place on Thursday at <unk> .
It goes on to say : &apos; I am not happy with the whole Conference in Durban , quite apart from the way in which the Middle East was discussed and the fact that someone like Castro was <unk> .
The introduction of limited liability would give Europe a definite advantage as a business location , and so I am glad that Commissioner McCreevy has agreed to this study , which needs to be completed soon , that is to say , by the end of 2006 .
Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , please persuade your group to allow more than a minute and a half .
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything .
I am also in agreement with Mrs Martens when she says that the timescale must be realistic .
I must , however , say to Mr Turmes that , despite what I have just said , we cannot consider <unk> to be a renewable energy .
I hope therefore that all the European institutions will be willing to proceed on that basis .
Lastly , there can be no doubt that we must take account of other general interests which fall entirely within the concept of public order - especially the interests of groups such as children , who must be protected from this uncontrollable <unk> of new technologies .
Just two more points : urban actions and policy for mountain areas .
Several members of the Green Group were in Lisbon and felt very disappointed about the whole event .
Mr President , last night I sat in the House of Commons and I listened to the Chief Secretary of the Government of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland .
I therefore say very clearly : we in the European Parliament have a job to do .
<unk> the right to information and consultation cannot , in my opinion , be a kind of <unk> of workers at a given time , given that when things are going well information and consultation are not necessary for doing business .
The first question concerns States .
As Mrs <unk> says , the momentum must not be lost , in particular as the problem continues to get worse with the Front National in its <unk> in southern France <unk> the libraries , <unk> the minorities and engaging in <unk> <unk> , as we speak .
If criminal behaviour becomes the norm in a community , that community is in trouble .
Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution Your presence here <unk> well for cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament .
I am opposed , however , to attempts by the EPP Group to restrict national airport systems to peripheral areas or to domestic flights .
Their position in relation to the European Union changes frequently , is extremely unclear , and is partly dependent on specific relationships with specific Member States they may be part of .
And if we have cause to go to the European Court , then let us do so and , if sanctions need to be imposed , then we shall do that too .
That was merely a month to the day after the vessel sank .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like you to tell me when you will be presenting the legislative proposals .
That is why I most particularly welcome the fact that our fellow MEPs from the Committee on Budgets have made every effort to provide the emergency aid of EUR 200 million for this year , Mr <unk> , and not for next year , there still being two and a half months of this year left .
If , nevertheless , discharge is granted to the Commission for the 1997 financial year , this then will mean that we will - once again - be giving them a major vote of confidence .
I very much hope we can talk about this , and that we will be able to discuss it in the coming year .
That is what I wanted to say on behalf of the Commission , and I thank Mr Alavanos once again for his report and the European Parliament in general for the welcome it has given this agreement , which is the result of very difficult and complicated negotiations .
This relates to quite a different matter , namely the use of various financial channels to fund such things as terrorist activities .
Also , on enlargement , in the space of twenty days in March and again with this Parliament &apos;s help , we opened the European Conference , we launched the accession process and we began the accession negotiations for enlargement .
This will bring about more efficiency , increased influence by Parliament , whilst the <unk> will have their customary role .
Having said that , what we need is for that list of problems not just to be accepted by Mr Blair , but also by the Council that will take place this weekend in the United Kingdom .
Many parties to this discussion process initially took the view that fraud could only be effectively combated if UCLAF became independent and were <unk> outside the Commission framework .
I share the opinion of the Committee of Inquiry that the Commission ought to be given a legal right to use our evidence in court .

I say this so that our colleague is properly informed .
Consequently , we do not want the EU to use its budget for distributing funds to organisations concerned with gender equality .
The Union raised again the problem of unimpeded and safe access for humanitarian workers on the ground in Chechnya .
Look at your groups !
I would simply use the opportunity of his question to emphasize strongly yet again that as an increasing number of people , including employers , come to understand the strong link between fair competition and efficient operation and decent social conditions , the environment in which the Commission is seeking to secure support for its initiatives in this sector is growing all the time .
It must be practical , and it must be focused .
How short are your memories ?
I therefore feel that the European Parliament too must express its <unk> of such acts in the most forceful terms , as the rest of the international community and , in particular , the other Community institutions have done by unequivocally condemning such barbarity .
The quality of their work strengthens the credibility of the European Parliament in its exercise of its share of Community powers .
- ( SV ) We have voted in favour of the report aimed at establishing a European Prosecutor .
Unlike my fellow MEP , Mrs Eriksson , I have the greatest confidence that the work you are now getting under way will also lead to a result .
If European parliamentary immunity is independent , the French authorities ought to have consulted us regarding the waiver of Mr Le Pen &apos; s immunity .
We are voting against the report on informing and consulting employees in national enterprises .
It reduced in real terms by 30 % .
Before the vote on the entire motion for a resolution Can I ask you specifically whether the debate on the services directive in the Council over the next couple of months will be open to the public , and whether the decisions made by the Member States individually will be available to the public ?
It is this model that , twelve years after the 1992 CAP reform , <unk> the profound injustice that 20 % of the major holdings receive 80 % of aid .
The directive will , on the one hand , promote the development of European financial markets and , on the other , benefit employees , who will profit from a more efficient and more transparent investment policy regarding their pensions .
Robert Schuman once said that Europe will not be made all at once , or according to a single plan .
Our objective , particularly bearing in mind enlargement , must be to involve the candidate countries in this process , and with an eye to the elections to Parliament in 2004 to ensure that equal representation of men and women can be achieved .
It is important that the break periods be simple and easy to understand and that a degree in <unk> is not required to apply them !
.
– Mr President , this own-initiative report , prepared jointly by myself and Mr <unk> <unk> , with the essential support of our respective <unk> , is a very important contribution to the ongoing debate about the future of Europe and the role that Europe ’ s social model can play in <unk> the unification of our continent .
I am thinking in particular of the <unk> <unk> .
Technological platforms are of particular importance for this objective , which are a model that has led to successes but that must find mechanisms to give SMEs access to the results of the technological platforms and to apply the latter ’ s innovations .
That is why I am <unk> surprised , and I would add that the annual report on human rights in the EU must not - as has unfortunately happened in the past - be the cause of a clash of views between different factions .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Solana , on behalf of the parties of Europe &apos;s <unk> , I can assure you that we share the view of Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten .
Mr President , allow me to make a brief contribution in my capacity as president of the Delegation for Central Asia and Mongolia , to demonstrate our support for the cooperation agreement with Kazakhstan being discussed today .
The Cartagena Protocol is designed to create a framework for international trade involving GMOs .
In conclusion , if we really want to engage in a serious discussion on integrated solutions to make our external borders more user-friendly to travellers who are third country nationals , whilst retaining essential security requirements , we ought to ensure that all the institutions and Member States are working together to ensure full implementation of the Schengen by the 10 new Member States as soon as possible .
It is precisely because the decision taken by the people of Latvia was such a complex one that it deserves recognition .
The previous speaker made this point .
That is a specific case in which we acted as intermediaries and basically each side saw the other &apos; s point of view , which finally proved the right approach to take .
The European Union &apos;s continuing attention was made clear through the recent visit in April to Chechnya itself of the <unk> of Heads of Mission in Moscow as well as through support for the resumption of the OSCE &apos;s activities in the region , which I mentioned earlier .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I will start by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Maaten , as there is a massive amount of lost ground to make up in relations between the EU and Asia .
So coordination and cooperation are facts of life .
We all wish him a speedy recovery .
Alas , my country does not only have the dubious honour of being known as a transit country for drugs , it is now also building itself a reputation for producing synthetic drugs .
The final lesson we must learn : a lot of attention is focused on the importance of Russia and America .
There is no justification for having size and duration of support , for example , as key criteria .
Mr President , as our knowledge of biotechnology grows , so the extent of the difficulties increases too .
We know that competition on a world scale requires that a distinction be drawn between regions , top regions and regions of excellence , which are mentioned in the Seventh Framework Programme for research and development .
At present , given the interest rate <unk> between the euro on the one hand , and the US dollar and the <unk> on the other , the net income from interest is positive .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I would like to make reference to the general speech by our group &apos;s Chairman and seize on a few , perhaps just small , details .
In so doing , we would be attaching a high value to local <unk> , and rightly so , for it is clear that local authorities are the political level closest to the public .
As a result , not only will our commitment to fighting the extreme right become a mask of hypocrisy ; it will be turned on its head .
The <unk> Serb oppression of the Albanian minority in Kosovo is a direct threat to peace and stability in the Balkans .
That was also something that Commissioner Byrne mentioned .
There is a real benefit from taking action now to <unk> employment opportunities .
They should be <unk> by the implication that NGOs were able to manipulate and manage their opinions in the way that some have said .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as the WTO Conference in Singapore approaches , Mr Kittelmann &apos;s excellent report combines a great many recommendations to governments , familiar items that are still unresolved and bold new proposals such as those for rules governing competition on a multilateral basis and environmentally compatible trade .
I refer in particular to the key principles of the open market economy in which competition is free ; to the fact that the European Central Bank can no longer have liberal statutes or a liberal mission ; to the Commission ’ s <unk> powers as regards competition or indeed the blatant <unk> of all European security and defence policy to the policy formed within NATO .
I also understand that you have proposed a number of amendments .
( IT ) Mr President , as usual , Mr Poettering had a <unk> smile on his <unk> when he came into the Hemicycle .
And this House took a very special interest in the fate of the people of Cambodia .
I am therefore in favour of completely clear labelling .
Mr Izquierdo <unk> &apos;s political group and my own , which are the two most important groups in the building of Europe , both agree that Europe will only be possible if it is based on two elements : a functioning market , and the strict application of the principle of social compensation .
Heads of State or Government who disregard the sovereign will of their nations may well find that the latter regard them as dictators , and deal with them accordingly .
If we believe in the reform process , we must endorse this second phase , which concerns the introduction , on a one-off basis , of the early retirement scheme for officials within the Commission .
This same time scale must be implemented for the common organization of the market in olive oil .
It is therefore vital that there should be a <unk> commitment on the part of Europe and all its institutions .
In this spirit , we are <unk> that special publicity be given to all complaints in order that any action taken is made more obvious .
They are , above all , focused on fighting poverty .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 and 16 will be taken together .
( The President declared the common position approved as amended ) I share the concerns and opinions that the rapporteur , Mrs Rühle , mentioned this afternoon regarding the sections on research and social measures .
I voted in favour on the basis of the following criteria : first , that the final decision by the European Council will not leave any grey areas , nor will the sovereign and other rights of the Republic of Cyprus be eroded and that assistance to the Turkish Cypriots will not sow seeds of division but will result in the reunification of Cyprus .
On the one hand we have a government with no connections to the armed forces and with a <unk> member of the <unk> for Nuclear <unk> as Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office , using the armed forces as a political tool to further its ambitions in Europe and apparently realising rather too late that the European Union defence scheme would indeed damage the NATO alliance and transatlantic relations .
What is there to fear in a Charter of Fundamental Rights ?
The Member States &apos; lack of solidarity , however , and <unk> to reform is making living together in an enlarged EU increasingly problematic .
We must take care that the work environment is not so confusing and complex as to encourage a growing variety of telecommunications systems , which are not at all compatible for the user .
This is the real situation .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , from your answer I gained the impression that the issue is not being faced with the attention its seriousness demands .
I congratulate them for their <unk> and the efficiency with which they pursued it .
That is because this amendment in no way <unk> transparency , which is the issue , and that is why I remain , as before , opposed to it .
.
German domination of Europe is fortunately a thing of the past , so please , Mr Schulz , remember this once and for all , and keep your German aspirations well clear of Poland ’ s internal affairs .
We must look at other possibilities , including <unk> and <unk> .
I am therefore making an urgent plea to the Council : do not go on discussing the French proposal to give another six or nine billion back to one operator , but instead give some thought to devising a programme that will enable you to actually make 3G a reality in Europe .
The next item is the statement by the Commission on British beef and veal .
At the Johannesburg Summit a 15 % increase in the production of alternative energy sources by 2010 was proposed .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am grateful for being given the floor and would like to thank Mr Jarzembowski and the other Members who contributed to the work on the whole railway package .
It follows that Mr Sacrédeus ’ appeal ought not to have been necessary , and that was the line we took ; that was what led to the Cyprus talks happening now .
But for heaven &apos; s sake Commissioner , by indicating today and <unk> also at your press conference , that there is another two weeks , you will make everyone read that as meaning that you have simply extended the deadline .
The Member States should therefore support any measure to safeguard linguistic diversity and limit the technical difficulties which prevent the achievement of the objective .
Mr President , in his speech , Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has already mentioned the forceful response from the Vice-President of the Commission , Mr Kinnock , to my question on the <unk> by Canadian inspectors of a Portuguese fishing vessel in NAFO waters .
The Commission therefore very much welcomes the fact that the same amendments have been <unk> , and counts on them being adopted .
Mr President , on page 27 of the annex to the Minutes my vote is recorded as having been cast in favour of Amendment No 20 to the Morillon report .
The Commission is fully aware that it is a subject of great regret to many that the legal proceedings begun with our letter were not pursued to their ultimate conclusion , but it has no doubt that its decision to <unk> the proceedings was the right one and was fully in conformity with the constant <unk> of the Court in the matter of infringement proceedings .
It contravenes Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of <unk> and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press .
Being able to explain a citizens ’ agenda – the people ’ s priorities – is a step forward .
Madam President , Sweden and the Swedish Green Party have a lot of experience of environmental charges .
We call upon the authorities in Laos immediately to put a stop to all policies involving the persecution and oppression of the <unk> people , other minorities in Laos and Christian population groups .
Subject : <unk> refunds Having noted the answer to my previous question ( <unk> / 00 ) , that &apos;the Commission simply proposes to adapt the calculation system used in order to take into account the price differences on the world market and in the Community for the cereals used as raw materials in relation to <unk> <unk> , does the Commission agree that the proposals to change the methodology for calculating the level of export <unk> rates affecting spirit drinks producers should be accompanied by a detailed explanation as to how this is to be achieved along with supporting justification ?
The matter was seriously delayed and did not return to Parliament until the middle of the summer .
I would like to end on a practical note .
This report is to be highly valued also from the point of view of enlargement .
If we opt today for a specific transitional period and if we are convinced today that it may not work , then we should say so in no uncertain terms , we should state our reasons and then those of us who said as much today will be able to say we were right all along .
I believe economics and ecology can actually go in tandem again here , because if we tackle this <unk> then as well as enormous benefits for the environment we will also be able to create jobs , jobs in small and medium-sized firms .
It received unanimous support in the Transport Committee .
The wretched fact is , of course , that Mr Mugabe has extended his term of power to an unreasonable length of time and has forgotten to settle the problem of land reform himself .
This is the first time of adopting this kind of action plan which will add new subjects to our list of priorities .
I will return to this point later .
I should in any event like to urge the Commission to support Commissioner Fischler in this respect , for the best way to stay within the financial limits is not to put the future of sugar policy at risk again , at least not before 2006 .
But the figures we already have also show that there has been insufficient take-up of the programmes .
The presentation of the programme for the forthcoming Spanish Presidency to the European Parliament will no doubt allow this debate to take place and deepen .
For example in paragraph 6 we <unk> that the Commission should have examined other factors such as wages , labour market flexibility , public fixed investment and social security costs which we point out , echoing the Commission , are in some instances using up as much as 50 % of Community GDP which is equal to the total share of government spending , something which you will find in paragraph 23 of our resolution .
The debate is closed .
Military action without UN approval will increase <unk> between the West and the Muslim world ; it will <unk> the Middle East and it will deal a devastating blow , not only to the credibility of the UN , but also to the future potential of the European Union Common and Foreign Security Policy .
It simply means that authorisation is given for animals which are vaccinated to be used in the food chain .
It was about a good mix of civil and military elements .
We welcome both the Commission &apos;s communication and its conviction that we need to create a European Union policy that both includes and concentrates on our cities .
The ability to read is therefore important for democracy .
China , the <unk> democratic Republic of the Congo , the United States and Iran have the sad record of coming at the top of the list of the countries which apply the death sentence .
As we had wished , it was possible , in the various actions , to achieve balanced allocation of resources between youth exchange and voluntary service .
Paragraph 1 of the resolution passed by the Parliament in January actually required the Committee of Wise Men to examine the way in which the European Commission systematically covers up fraud , mismanagement and corruption ; and that is not in the report , especially if I may say so in relation to the saga on tourism .
( <unk> from Mr Samland : <unk> the finance ministers that ! )
Let us understand this at last : the market cannot provide solutions for social problems , nor for the problems of infrastructure and public service development .
It would be useful if the Council , whose President is currently the Portuguese Prime Minister , could respond with equal <unk> to the criticism made of a Portuguese Member of this House , and did not maintain the <unk> stance that it has adopted concerning the offence that the Angolan Government has caused to that Member of this House , as well as to the institutions of the European Union .
I assume that this is an omission and I would be grateful if it could be resolved before the vote tomorrow .
It seems clear to me , however , that this is also a great opportunity to build bridges to Russia .
Because without information it is not possible to draft a policy and without a knowledge of the true state of affairs it is not possible to create proper programmes .
The position of most EPP members ( happily there are some sensible MEPs amongst them ) and the UPE is altogether incredible and <unk> , given that both President Santer and Commissioner van den Broek have indicated that they beg to differ from Parliament on the question of projects in Turkey .
Mr President , Mrs <unk> has carried out an important piece of parliamentary work with this report .
Nevertheless , please consider the progress made with regard to other areas .
We need to persevere down this road .
Yesterday , we heard the Council and the Commission talk about the <unk> start of the macroeconomic dialogue , but opinions and indications from this will not be published - this is what we were told .
I believe that this <unk> form of monitoring is very important .
Moreover , improvements to the UN resolutions are now slowly taking place .
The first part of the amendment would then read <unk> gradually all export subsidies &apos; .
The obligation of public and private television broadcasters to allocate a proportion of their annual net income to investment in production and to the acquisition of European audiovisual programmes , including films , works aimed at minorities and ones made by independent producers , must be included in this piece of legislation .
Both the majority in committee and I as rapporteur have taken note of the Council conclusions ; we do not question these decisions , but we do judge these two proposals for regulations on the basis of principles and statements .
This is an excellent way in which to begin the century .
On 1 January 1999 , a single customs code , consistent with European Union rules , came into force , and progress has been made in harmonising the trade regimes of both entities .
Unfortunately , at present there are still too many legal and administrative obstacles preventing our businesses and consumers from considering the whole of the European Community as their true domestic market .
Mrs <unk> , I have to tell you too that it is not a question of my personal view nor of the presidency &apos;s view .
That is not clear at all .
I therefore request that these topics , on which a common position has already been reached , should be included in the next regulations .
Many people saw this as an additional cost to the consumer , yet we are being told by the government that it was not an extra charge .
Mr President , regional integration is one of the fundamental causes of change in the world order today .
All this looks very different from the <unk> concept , which is what I think of when we talk about the numerous instruments that are available .
Cooperation among the three institutions is indeed a top priority , especially while the new institutions are being set up .
They call me in <unk> to describe having their cars dismantled and their children <unk> by customs officers .
It is also based on the rule of law , common to all Member States .
In putting our proposals into effect we shall be working with the industry , the social partners and the Member States to examine step by step what still needs to be done and where the greatest successes have been achieved .
Do you speak in the name of all of your Group , or just one part of it ?
Clearly , not all of them will be taken up in the form which this Parliament has advocated .
Furthermore , the spirit of the amendment is to be found in other previous amendments which the Commission can accept .
As regards the procedures , the Corbett report introduces <unk> worthy of the <unk> Roman <unk> in the best <unk> tradition - no offence to the <unk> .
Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter ?
The cost , of course , will not be borne by the shipowners who have been pushing in that direction , but will emerge in the end price , in other words the price paid by the travelling public and in consumer prices for goods .
This is why I warmly support this urgent procedure .
The legal framework of the internal market also plays an important role in this field .
It seems to us that this contradicts the very principles of the treaty .
In addition , the Commission has promised the Council that it will draw up a working document clarifying which Community instruments can be used by Member States in that connection .
Not since the 1960s has there been greater depopulation of the Swedish countryside .
As Mrs Wallström has said : The real and immediate danger in the Balkans comes from general environmental degradation following years of neglect , corruption and war .
We have now committed ourselves to tabling before long a proposal for revision of the existing proposal and for new targets .
( PT ) Some people have specific <unk> requirements and sweeteners provide considerable advantages for these individuals , in particular allowing them to use products containing fewer <unk> .
Digital <unk> obviously makes profound differences to some , especially in the field of music reproduction , which we need to take account of that and protect it as fully as we can .
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February .
We have to look at ways in which Europe can add value to research which otherwise might be going on or , for that matter , to initiate research which is not likely to take off .
There has been no real , practical improvement in the situation of women , in particular , despite Mr <unk> &apos;s statements .
If Europe is going to be something more than just an internal market and achieve its hope for economic and social cohesion , it must develop services for the benefit of all at European level .
We must have a second UN resolution , we must have a clear timetable in order to say inspectors can go on for so long but no further .
( FR ) The proposal for a decision on the implementing powers conferred on the Commission by the Council - prepared by the Commission itself - is in line with the wishes of the European Parliament , which has just warmly approved it .
We need to maintain a system of legally binding rules , equipped with effective sanctions , applied by public bodies entrusted with the tasks of guidance and monitoring .
For example , the Palestinian Authority has taken steps : the reform of the Finance Ministry , the creation of the post of Prime Minister and the support of the Legislative Council .
The justice which is not being done and the refugee camps which are becoming permanent are areas for confrontation between the old and the new powers in Indonesia and reveal the <unk> of the democratisation process .
Good governance in these developing countries is , however , an essential prerequisite if the cooperation which is vital for the achievement of the objectives we have set is to be strengthened .
It is absurd that as part of the agreement , the EU should pay money to the governments of those countries in order to help the fishermen to find other jobs .
I do not want to go into a lot of detail about the agreement but just let me say that none of the parties get 100 % of what they want .
Finally , it ‘ &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> the measures taken by the EU in the international fight against terrorism ’ .
I therefore do not wish to embark on a full discussion here and now .
Naturally , we all believe it would be <unk> to <unk> on the <unk> scenario in Israel .
As the rapporteur says , all things considered , the result is better than nothing .
I welcome the debates which took place this week in the European Parliament on the uses of alternative energy resources .
I have just two comments on the <unk> report .
In this sense , the Member States must modify and revise their legislation in order to define more precisely crimes against sexual freedom , taking into account the age of the victims .
The time has therefore come to consider seriously the possibility of investing in alternative supply routes , improving dialogue with stable partners , such as the Republic of Kazakhstan , for example .
Yet it cannot be denied that the immigrants currently entering the European countries are mainly unskilled and come from countries where work experience in businesses such as ours is very scarce .
There are some examples of the transportation of animals which already meet the requirements of animal protection .
The Committee on Budgetary Control <unk> an onslaught of harsh criticism by some and was at the same time given the benefit of the doubt by others .
They cannot just apply on holidays and in times of peace .
In over a thousand years of its history , my nation has demonstrated that it is not afraid of difficult challenges .
Mr President , yet another rigorous budget , yet another budget prepared against a backdrop of disagreement about the future financing of the European Union : this exercise , which is repeated every year , is becoming <unk> .
In the immediate , you will understand why , for all these reasons , our group cannot vote otherwise than against this report .
According to current estimates , there are around 600 million Internet users and this figure is increasing on a daily basis .
I do not believe so , and when we learn the results of surveys on whether young people are more vulnerable when it comes to advertising , this claim will be even harder to justify .
Subject : CFSP : Future prospects for Kosova Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to express , on behalf of the Socialist Group , our condolences for today &apos; s latest victims and begin by stating one fact : that we have returned in terms of rhetoric and actions to a situation which had begun to <unk> after the Madrid Conference .
I can even envisage that a codecision procedure between Parliament and the Council will be needed on a number of options relating to monetary union .
In any event , it is clear that the euro has had a definite impact on financial integration and has created the conditions for a broad and very <unk> European market .
London leads the way in the EU tax battle &apos; , &apos; Swiss banks see no need for action &apos; , &apos; all financial centres must cooperate to do away with banking secrecy &apos; .
As for disciplinary procedures , pledges have been made here too , but no clear rules have been formulated so far , nor have we seen or heard any clear statements as to how such rules would be enforced , nor has the question of external agencies been <unk> resolved .
So we may be talking about different requirements for translation .
These are factors which need to be taken seriously and now is the time to raise these issues .
If there is one constant in the European Community - which today is the European Union - then it is the desire for change and the possibility of achieving it .
In other words , it depends on how we spend the money .
I readily endorse everything which has been said on this matter .
Although we know that the majority of these societies do sound work , they must no longer be permitted to be <unk> in what they do .
We must adopt a real strategic decision quickly , as the rapporteur recommends .
I would also like to emphasise the role of Parliament .
I appeal to your <unk> !
A balance must be achieved .
Obviously , I am thinking particularly , in this case , of Iran and of the problems in relation to North Korea .
We need to ensure that the requests , recommendations and demands contained in this motion for a resolution are not ignored or given less importance than the aims that are regarded as more important due to the fact that all political and social action is <unk> by the reactions of the so-called markets .
There was broad agreement within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that the information initiatives should be concentrated on those countries which have not yet introduced the single currency and , to a certain extent , also on candidate countries , which will introduce the single currency one day .
In a few years , as President Clinton said in a speech on 1 July 1997 , billions of dollars will be exchanged in this way .
What you are doing this morning opens up the way to a shared future for all of us , both the Commission and the broad majority in the European Parliament .
In the short time available to me I want to focus on recent events , but firstly I want to say that a number of key European industries are facing unprecedented difficulties .
<unk> though this may sound , the dramatic events of the past year seem to have served as a <unk> call to many , making us realise that it is pointless simply to <unk> the national black lists .
<unk> for not answering your question .
But it is specifically in the area of enlargement that it is vital to make sure EU environmental legislation is not weakened , but that it is continually improved .
Its agenda includes employment , the single currency , the reform of the Union in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference : in other words , many of the great issues that raise questions about our intentions for the Union &apos;s future .
Even today , in many cases of child pornography crimes , the inadequate minimum penalties available mean that a suspended sentence is imposed .
Now the measures also include <unk> .
Mr President , this decision , in as far as it goes , will make a small contribution to the creation of a European area of justice , but it is these small things , these small stones , that will build the foundations of a European area of justice capable of protecting our citizens .
Mr President , Europe normally finds it hard to assess the impact of government policy .
Mark <unk> once said that ‘ All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence , and then success is sure ’ .
The word <unk> &apos; has also been clarified , and a number of <unk> have been removed .
Once again we are here , this time to seek to highlight the ‘ <unk> education ’ campaign conducted in Tibetan monasteries .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , sparkling wines are always associated with festivities and <unk> .

The Commission therefore feels that it is important , both in order to simplify the administrative procedures and from the point of view of the savings that can be made in payments to the Bank , to take over the financial management of the Fund itself , including the investment of the resources available .
All this goes beyond a <unk> of the provisions in question .

The financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic undoubtedly suffer from the same ills : constant conflicts of interest , calculation methods that <unk> scrutiny and weaknesses in the monitoring of <unk> operations and of <unk> transactions .
We will not allow social and environmental acquis to be brought once more into question through a common investment strategy .

I hope that the Commission will be courageous enough to seize this opportunity and to come to this decision for itself .
At present , our role is to implement these new instruments for the benefit of the public , and I wonder whether this might not be the right time for our institution to take a look at whether those priorities that take the form of a legislative programme have a future .
Over the last few days we have become very much aware of social unrest resulting from essential proposals to reform pensions systems .
In short , we are not handing out <unk> ; we are returning the money to its original owners , i. e. the Member States and , at the end of the day , the taxpayers .
And I would call on the public and the institutions to take a close look at how intentions are converted into procedures and working methods .
Many of these regions have been deprived of tens and hundreds of young ambitious people , scientists , doctors , who have left in the last fifteen years for the old Europe and they are contributing to their successful economies .
The Council intends to resolve the matter by cutting a good proportion of the aid to Russia and the Mediterranean area with the rest coming from proportionate reductions in the other external programmes .

Given this contradiction , I feel that what you read out , which is &quot; gross national product &quot; must be right and not what was written in the original version which is &quot; gross domestic product &quot; , which is quite different .
So they should be , but let us look above all at what the Member States are doing .

Thus , we need to put the protection of victims at the centre of the debate on justice .
That is not on !

We MEPs have therefore altered this grace period to two years and set the figure to be attained at 25 % .

Let me now turn to something originally mentioned by Mrs Flemming : the Roma and <unk> .

The line between the acceptable and the unacceptable cannot be so thin .
<unk> health is one of the fundamental aspects of development and principally , but not solely , affects the developing countries .
The first point is the strategic goal .

That is not foreseeable at the moment , though .

– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party .
I must admit that I had to smile when you said that the extraordinary summit of Heads of State or Government also needed to help to fire our citizens with enthusiasm for Europe , and that this could not be done <unk> .
As far as Council reforms are concerned , three issues appear to me to be of major importance .
I come from a southern country and to tell you the truth I have very often thought : &apos; Who could silence that <unk> next door !
We come up here against what I regard as an extremely important principle : that we elected politicians ought to enjoy no special <unk> over our fellow citizens .
The Commission needs to codify these minimum standards clearly .
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteurs , Mrs Pollack , Mrs Napoletano and <unk> Novo , for the reports they are presenting today .

Mr President , this report is like a mosaic which has the virtue of being in many different parts and therefore raising many issues .
.
– Mr President , the impressive mobilisation of global and European public opinion is inciting both governments and the European Union to act more effectively by strengthening international cooperation under the aegis of the UN .
My third point is this : if the agreement is implemented , information networks will be set up under Article 6 .
That is not what we want .
No !
We must recognise that the European Union is jointly responsible for this situation .
We are all <unk> or <unk> .
Agreement has now been reached on 50 million .
Mr Caudron , you will perhaps think that I , too , am obsessed with reducing public deficits , but I only have one obsession , that is , my obsession with growth and unemployment .
Finally , the <unk> proposal to exempt <unk> is unacceptable .
My party , the Socialist Party , is the largest of the parties that , in the Netherlands , <unk> a successful campaign against this draft Constitutional Treaty .
This is particularly important with regard to regulations on working time concerning night work and other activities which may represent a danger to road safety .
The second problem , which will clearly have to be solved as soon as possible , concerns Cyprus .
It is also crucial , however , that the essence of this policy is made irreversible , depending on how the Community method is used .
.
The international press reports that the Algerian Minister for Internal Affairs , Mr <unk> <unk> , refuses - in violation of the procedures provided in law for setting up political associations and parties - to recognise the <unk> party led by the former minister , <unk> <unk> , which has been set up in full compliance with current legislation .
The South African delegation is headed by Mr <unk> <unk> , President of the House .

Only in this way can the European Parliament live up to the image it seeks to have .
Were the price were to drop below face value , people would be encouraged to buy gold and make their own coins .
We will advocate simpler and more transparent systems , but we will not advocate putting even more pressure on the citizens of the Union in the form of additional taxation .
At a time when there are many questions with regard to what Europe is doing and what it is about , the one area where we can claim to have success and where we have responded to the concerns of European citizens is in the area of public health .
Quite rightly !
This partnership is a valued component in the policy for the outermost regions .
No wonder many people simply give up before even trying .
That the two <unk> rights , of <unk> and petition , are <unk> .
That is unacceptable .
We were in constant touch with the French authorities and brought what pressure we could to bear on events .
<unk> could be put forward in favour of both spectrum auctions and so-called <unk> <unk> .
These lie outside the Community powers based on Article 129 or deal with matters that fall within the scope of other pillars of the Treaty , the exact point Sir <unk> <unk> has been making for some time .
In any event , the important thing is to carry out the work on the <unk> route and the Brenner tunnel , which are key and definitive elements , but which are going to take some time .

In that country alone there have been 800 000 internally displaced people since 1996 ; 123 000 new internally displaced people between January and June last year .
Mr Brinkhorst , you have studied the Rules of Procedure .
The large majority of citizens call for stricter measures to prevent pollution from ships , which affects not only the environment and public health but also fishing and tourism .
You also said that because of this certain basic conditions must be created in the area of environmental policy , social policy , consumer policy , and safeguarding competition through controls on competition and on financial aid , so that the single market can function as a single market for the whole of Europe and not in small sections .
That is what our committee wishes to see .
The attempt has often been made to create a common market organisation for alcohol in the EU .
It will unite us and will strengthen us at the same time , without any significant cost and with far less risk .
The first is in relation to Mr <unk> &apos;s attack on a Belgian minister who is not here to defend herself .
In my judgement , this provision is one of the first things that should be submitted to scrutiny after the Constitution has entered into force .
Secondly , we can only agree to the method of supplying and distributing the food aid , while hoping that the Russian public authorities will be able to distribute the products free to the <unk> people .
Why are we asking Russia to withdraw its military forces from Georgia and Moldova – and rightly so – but not asking the same of Turkey ?
He has to go back to England , but he will certainly follow up the issues and discuss them in detail .
I will focus on two types : one is the family member .
It may not be possible to achieve all this in this six-month period , but we should adopt this approach of creating a basic treaty and a general treaty .
The security conditions in the Northern Caucasus are still <unk> , which means that there are considerable logistical problems .
In particular , to contribute to economic growth , it is fundamental that Europe becomes , first and foremost , a real <unk> of <unk> for highly skilled migrants .

Firstly , the question of competition between ports .
The <unk> era must therefore be a time for credible action .
But , of course , the five permanent nuclear weapons powers must also accept their responsibility and follow the measures they promised in Article 6 of the non-proliferation treaty , namely to seriously negotiate a real reduction in nuclear weapons .
I , for example , am in total agreement with the report where it says that ultimately , the Directorates-General within the Commission should also bear not only the political and administrative responsibility but also financial responsibility .
Ladies and gentlemen , even if a moment &apos;s <unk> <unk> your attention from our voting sheet , you still have , fortunately , our Group leaders to guide you .
I also believe that the action which we have carried out together since 1996 , following the Madrid European Council at the end of 1995 , has largely achieved its objective of mobilisation .
The scope of the regulation is absolutely clear on that as well : global warming reduction targets , air quality improvement .
While our proposals are too <unk> for some people , for others they go too far .
But it is not an end in itself and should not be seen as a <unk> for all the problems that our partners face .
The unification of Europe in the 19th century was borne primarily by the workers &apos; movement and parts of the liberal <unk> .
I regret that the Commission rejected the proposal to phase out subsidies in 1996 and instead opted for reform proposals .
Today we have a new crisis , and we are again called upon to play a role which I think must be decisive .
Mr President , Commissioner , because of the Green Paper I am not <unk> that this matter arising will be sorted out satisfactorily in this House , as we are still seeing some resistance to any liberalization on this point , particularly on the part the socialists .
This approach would help strengthen the mutual trust on which the construction of the European judicial area depends , both in the Union as it is today and , later , in a Europe enlarged to 25 or 30 Member States .
Therefore , I can only encourage those who are really in favour of this policy to put pressure on Member States to finance it to the level we regard as necessary , in order to give rural development policy a proper future .
The Commission is acutely aware of the weight of these <unk> .
So , for example , in one lift we have a <unk> for light wood <unk> which , if we are in agreement , may be used to improve other <unk> .
There are avenues open to those who wish to challenge this situation if they believe that Community law is being <unk> .
I am starting to know what <unk> <unk> must have felt like , as he <unk> on making <unk> appearances until he was into his <unk> .
But I would stress that the second <unk> lays special emphasis on improving the production system as a means of stimulating economic growth and creating jobs , for to reduce the extremely high unemployment figure is our common concern , which is why vocational training measures are receiving considerably more support .
I will read you what it says : Mr President , Chancellor , Commissioner , the most significant issue during the Austrian Presidency was the agreement on new economic guidelines for the period 2007 – 2013 .
Most Member States are <unk> about the approach being taken by the scientific <unk> and would prefer a more open and transparent system of classification as set out in the OIE code which is recognised and accepted by countries worldwide .
It also goes much further , however , by presenting a statute that <unk> at European level all aspects of the situation of members of parliament and cuts essential links with their countries of origin , in particular remuneration .
We have therefore tabled two amendments in order to specifically strengthen this aspect , as we feel it is necessary , and to contribute in a small way to improving the motion for a resolution to be adopted , without causing any imbalance .
I believe that we would be making a great error if , in order to combat illegal immigration , we did not make an effort to cooperate with the countries from which the immigrants originate .
While recognising that progress has been made in the common position , the result - I must say in passing - of initiatives taken by the European Parliament , sufficient progress has not been made .
We have spoken to Commissioner Papoutsis and we agree that the directive is urgently needed .
I just have certain worries about the automatic <unk> and suspect that we might need some <unk> at a later stage .
I voted in favour of the report on the introduction of the single currency , and I am delighted with the progress that has been made in Member States of the EU in terms of convergence in readiness for the third stage of EMU .
... and you call yourselves democrats , when you do not even listen to what is being said ?
Mr President , in my opinion , the debate we shall have at the beginning of next Wednesday afternoon on the 29 agricultural rules for the next season is probably one of the most important of all the debates we have during our parliamentary year .
In my view , the rapporteur gives too little attention to the importance of this in his approach .
The challenge is enormous , but the extent of this tragedy demands that we make an enormous effort and commitment to put an end to this situation .
They have concluded that the pace at which electronic money is likely to come into European economies is not sufficiently fast for it to be a factor by 1 January 2002 .
Secondly , our positions are politically <unk> too , on the one hand because the wishes expressed in this Financial Perspective are consistent with the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives and on the other hand because those of our fellow citizens who want to take the trouble to <unk> out the content of this Financial Perspective will find in it , I believe , a manifestation of our will to enhance our regions while improving our ability to master the challenges of the future .
It nevertheless shows that women are voted for if they simply stand for election .
Indeed , I seem to remember , as you have just stated , that the members of the Canadian delegation expressed their regrets at this incident and offered their apologies .
<unk> in 1999 for alleged participation in bomb attacks , <unk> <unk> &apos;s health has deteriorated seriously as a result of his unlawful <unk> .
So an appropriate budget is of paramount importance .
And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities ?
I cannot do anything for 2007 , because we do not have the financial perspective .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , the leader of the independent libraries movement in Cuba , has been awarded the <unk> <unk> democracy prize .
This matter is particularly serious as it clearly shows that the powers of coercion given to the European Union can easily be used against national democratic expression .
The <unk> from Basel II must not , however hit those who had no part in <unk> the financial markets - in particular the small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union , who , as is constantly reiterated , form the backbone of our economy and are the only means whereby we may be brought out of economic crisis .
I believe that tax competition <unk> opportunities within the EU and it enables small countries on the periphery of the Union to compete .
<unk> need to prepare for this .
When we look at the huge mountain of work we must tackle jointly in the next few years - and let me address my own forthcoming presidency here and say that not even the German Presidency can accomplish it all , we should not expect any <unk> of the Germans - we must also realise that we have to reform the key players , the institutions .
Every one of the lives lost there is of equal value .
Such is the case , for example , of <unk> and Macedonia .
I believe that the EU ’ s Green Paper <unk> the mental health of the population &apos; is the first important step in pursuing a common solution .
( FR ) The fact that , after eight years of negotiations , the European authorities cannot even obtain reliable information on the production of waste , particularly industrial waste , and its treatment , is indicative of their powerlessness .
For example , the <unk> d <unk> is a play in Catalan which takes place every year during these holidays .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has identified Articles 3 , 6 and 7 as being in particular need of amendment .
A convergence rate also needs to be established .
For that reason it is my sincere wish , Commissioner , and not just a <unk> hope , that in future negotiations the Commission will provide Parliament with comprehensive information from the very start and keep it abreast of the latest developments in the negotiating process .
Time after time , this resulted in delays for political reasons , leading to adjustments being made under <unk> conditions ; such difficulties must be avoided with the new system .

As part of this , I have proposed in my report that they set up something called an ethical investment committee on the lines of remuneration committees and other committees in <unk> of directors .
Mr President , Commissioner , the speech we just heard was in fact an excellent bridge to mine .

I was the rapporteur on enlargement in Eastern Europe and internal security .
With regard to relations between Armenia and Turkey , which we hope will be positive in future , all that the European Union has done is to try to ensure that Turkey complies with the European Union &apos; s normal framework of external relations .
We must ensure that these administrations play a significant role .
Finally , Commissioner Verheugen , as a Greek , I should like to thank you warmly for your <unk> efforts to help bring about a fair and sustainable solution to the Cyprus problem .
She spoke about Brazil , but I should like to start close to home in discussing biodiversity .

Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as we have already said , the backdrop to Mr Sturdy &apos; s report is the dramatic context , both for farmers and consumers , we should remember , of the BSE crisis and the resources put in place to eradicate it .
I asked him to join us , as soon as he returns , to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the EU has already taken , and those which we are going to take .
This does not merit such <unk> .
Many of the victims of the past few days were badly <unk> before they were killed and most of the paramilitary attacks were in the north of the country .
We set up a green card system some time ago , and this takes it further within the EU .
The report gives the Commission a much stronger role in the evaluation system .

I am particularly satisfied with the report &apos;s mention that part of the SME structural funding programme should be aimed at funds for third sector SME &apos;s , especially for public health , education and the <unk> .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to stress that I am grateful to see Point 7 , the special purchasing programme .
I hope Mr Flynn does not think we are plundering Article 10 because we will be using those funds for social and employment initiatives as well .
The conference has shown that , over the past couple of years , we have indeed made progress and we have done so in many areas .
You admitted as much as soon as the meeting of the Conciliation Committee was over .
This is undoubtedly a long and difficult task , but one that is of crucial importance .
Mr Dell &apos;Alba and Mr De <unk> , the objection that you raised to putting the subject of Iraq on the agenda as an urgent matter is now void , given the decision we have just taken .
In 2004 , every <unk> new car <unk> in Europe was an <unk> vehicle .
I want to thank Ms De <unk> for her very valuable report on human rights in the world in 2003 and the EU &apos;s policy on the matter .
The EIB generally has to follow the policies of the Union but it has its own decision-making structure and the Board of <unk> is composed of finance ministers from the Member States and they are charged with implementing the policies of the Union in the execution of their duties .
In considering what I should say this morning I was struck once again , by the difference between the strength of the <unk> and the <unk> that we use to describe the situation and the strength of the <unk> we use in trying to resolve it .
Another task for 2003 is the development of some visions as to the nature of our <unk> and institutionalised cooperation with those countries that will not be members of the European Union but will not be complete <unk> either .
I would remind the House that there can be no European cohesion without European solidarity .
Thank goodness we have President <unk> and the French Presidency which , I think , has taken up and taken a leading role in the matter of unifying and developing and strengthening our sporting structures .

The Americans have gone in exactly the opposite direction .
Not only the governments but also these people need to be motivated to contribute actively to achieving the Lisbon goals .
It is for that reason that I suggest that we must <unk> a special place within the treaties for public services of common interest , ensure that they are protected from the most rigorous application of competition policy and ensure in future that citizens have a right , as a minimum , to a guaranteed level of public services in order to maintain solidarity throughout the Union .
But here this is not what is <unk> the rapporteur and the authors of most of the amendments : instead , it is primarily , if not exclusively , the interests of the capitalist groups who manufacture food supplements .

The Commission also accepts the following amendments in part : Nos 7 and 15 , which promise that , in negotiations , third countries will be urged to apply the regulation ; No 11 , which improves the definition of persons entitled to compensation ; No 13 , which introduces greater flexibility as regards the advance payments under Article 4 ; and No 14 , which gives passengers <unk> rights to information under Article 5 .

That is why we support the granting of debt relief to developing countries , as Mr Martin mentioned .
I believe the way forward for power stations and the like may lie in a different direction in the long term , but that fossil fuels in particular , which are used almost exclusively in transport today , can gradually be replaced by renewables and <unk> from that source .
Rather , the restructured <unk> would provide an overview and advise the Council and the Commission .
My second subject for today is the analysis of the Commission &apos;s human and financial resources .
This explains the current high volume exported to Lebanon .
But this programme to <unk> new power stations , which I think is excellent , should deliver more .
$ 1 , 000 million have been given .
We have voted for the Buitenweg report which supports and improves , in several respects , the proposal for a Council directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin .
Obviously , if we are in agreement from one side of this House to the other , it means that this approach , and this one alone , is the right one .
That is the general guideline for the use of structural funds and other funds .
More generally , the efforts of the Committee of Inquiry have once again made it plain that Parliament too wishes significantly to boost efforts to tackle fraud involving EC budget funds .
I thank you .
The dialogue we opened with these countries on that matter , as well as what has been included on this in the present priorities , reflect in my view the vital importance of ensuring that the countries which wish to join , qualify first and foremost as democratic nations , nations which respect the principles of the rule of law , human rights , and above all the protection of the rights of minorities .
<unk> must be taken to avoid such disturbance once and for all .
They are easily influenced by the tough <unk> who died of lung cancer himself by the way .
Finally , the Cox report retains optional exemptions which the Member States are at liberty to grant , while nevertheless tightening up the conditions .
The proposal by Mr <unk> , the rapporteur , to set up a Committee on <unk> <unk> and the Prevention of Pollution by <unk> , which would replace the current committees , is another step towards the renationalisation of Community policy on maritime safety , but is also an extra asset for improving monitoring of the implementation of Community and international regulations .
There is absolutely no doubt that our preventive measures were instrumental in this .
Turning now to the substance – and I think that we are in full agreement on all of these points – I noted that several principles emerged from your discussion : efficiency , supervision and responsibility , all subject to an overriding principle of <unk> , which I thought your rapporteur expressed very well .
That protection is something of which we should be proud .
The Commission &apos;s proposal is a good proposal and therefore should be wholeheartedly supported .
The specific characteristics of agricultural production mean that we Europeans have a number of reasons for not being in favour of the complete deregulation of agricultural markets , and so we seek to retain state intervention in favour of agriculture .
The Council urges the Member States and the acceding countries to implement effectively the <unk> for immediate and future actions by the Network Committee and contribute actively to setting up a specific expert group on <unk> under the Network Committee to develop common modalities and advice on health measures across Europe .

These are the actual data , given that those who have not been born cannot be born in the future : these are the current demographic statistics .
Are there any objections ?
This is why , just as our group chairman asked the President of the Commission , I should like the Commission to tell me exactly what its information plan looks like , and I should also like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether it might not be a good idea to discuss this with the government leaders at this important European Council after all ?
If anyone in particular is to be thanked for this unexpected turn of events , it is the Luxembourg presidency , although I can well imagine that it would have preferred – and regarded it as more important – to achieve success elsewhere .
The <unk> concluded that the programme did indeed improve awareness , its target groups have been reached , especially law enforcement officials , and its activities and information exchanges were considered relevant to the objectives of the programme .
UCLAF is still young - not yet ten years old - and of course it has experienced growing pains .
In some countries these large public institutions are finding it hard to face up to this situation .
Every Member State will have its part to play in ensuring that another <unk> cannot escape the vigilance of justice in the future .
That means you have to take the thing out every time , then you lose it and so on and so forth , because it gets dropped .
.
That is fair enough !
Nor can I understand why it accepted the increase from 55 % to 62 % in Spain &apos;s share of the Cohesion Fund , and the reduction of its own share from 18 % to 17 % .
I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for the amount of work she has put into it .

A month ago we insisted on something better .
At the end of the day it is crucial that we double the funds as a percentage of GDP .
Yesterday evening &apos;s unilateral decision by Britain is reprehensible , primarily because it is unilateral .
That is the only change .
The most incredible thing in this matter , apart from the <unk> of our institutions , is that the pretext of <unk> tension is always used to explain such conflicts .
In this respect I believe that the future is certain , as you said ; the timing may not be quite certain but it will happen and that is good , that is important .
Such are the <unk> of lobbies which are <unk> around the issue .
This should help to ensure that both programmes are more focused and that each gets the level of visibility and funding it deserves .
It is a market worth billions and could create many new jobs here in Europe , particularly when one considers that the only possession many Chinese have to their name is a <unk> of <unk> .

South Africa is ravaged by crime , and a culture of violence has taken a grip on the country .
The Commission &apos;s proposals will be presented in Parliament in November .

In March , the European Council will conduct the mid-term review of the Lisbon process .
I have found in all of you in the European Parliament , and all <unk> of humanity , the passion to go on .
Fourthly , the strengthening of the social partners ’ role through recognition of the significance of the social dialogue and trialogue .
The Annan Plan offers Cyprus a chance for reconciliation and renewal .
As you can see , this provides some incentive for you to attend in great numbers on Friday in order to vote .
I feel that this matter should be dealt with at the level of the European Union so as to ensure uniformity in the rules which apply within all the Member States and territories of the EU itself .
The report has many good things to say but it does not contain what in my opinion are the most essential measures to increase employment in the countries of the Union , namely : It is costing the Council nothing but fine words !
This is sometimes translated into Dutch as <unk> &apos; - with good reason , and the interpreters have been using that word repeatedly this evening - but the agenda also mentions <unk> &apos; on one occasion , which is , of course , the exact opposite of <unk> &apos; .
For the first time , the cooperation of liaison officers posted by Member States to serve in third countries is put on an institutional footing and specifically regulated .
It has come to my attention that there is in existence an unofficial list of candidates for membership of the Commission , and that on this list there are only three women .
The sudden death of General <unk> may just possibly clear the way for a more hopeful future , but that is by no means certain .
In the case of many Members of this House , however , these lofty principles fail them when it comes to decisions at home .
Ever since the <unk> was published by the Commission they have been duty bound to discuss with us the revision of the Financial Perspective which was proposed by the Commission .
It remains an urgent requirement to promote a stability pact using all contacts we have through the European Commission &apos; s links with the United Nations and to promote the political awareness and energy of those who work there , so as to arrive at a stability pact .

It should be noted that according to the World Health Organisation &apos;s definition , health is &apos;a state of complete physical , mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or <unk> &apos; .
Among the reasons why things have not worked as well as they should in the past have been the lack of impact assessments of legislative proposals and the inadequate way in which the consultation of stakeholders has been conducted .
On these lines , I should like to inform you that back in 1996 , Commissioner Papoutsis opened the European <unk> Council on <unk> <unk> in Brussels in the presence of various senior officials from the Commission and other organisations .
The European Union will help in a variety of ways to find a solution to this crisis , but , obviously , the parties themselves hold the keys to that .
In addition it should promote integration processes within the Mediterranean partner countries and strengthen our dialogue in the field of economic policy .
I said there was pressure to improve health but what is more important is that the pressure is realistic .
I should like to proceed directly to the specific point that I know has been the subject of extremely intensive debate in Parliament .
I believe that there are some extremely important things we could do ourselves : for example , the idea of going to the forthcoming summit on the environment with a united voice , with one single voice , the voice of Europe ; the possibility of developing the idea of internal cohesion .
I have listened very closely and should like to start by dealing with the question posed by many Members ; that is , whether the Commission can guarantee that the funding required to ensure the necessary scientific and <unk> safeguards for this legislative proposal will be made available within the Seventh Framework Research Programme .
2 .
That will be looked into .
There ought , however , to have been more respect for democratic debate and for the opportunity for civil society to take part in the debate .
Finally , Madam President , I apologise for exceeding my speaking time and I would like to say that a complete list of the Commission ’ s position on all the amendments is available to Parliament .

As a <unk> of Parliament &apos;s Committee on Budgetary Control , I was astonished to read the answer I received from the Council to my question of 1 October concerning the ending of duty-free sales .

I find it all the more regrettable that three group chairmen this morning issued a press release on this important question , which really depends on a consensus in this House ; I think that was completely intolerable .
1 ) The Gothenburg Council must produce a global strategy for sustainable development .
However , the assumption is made that greater liberalisation of trade will lead to greater economic development .
The report fails to discuss environmental problems thoroughly enough , and hardly at all , in fact .
.
The Commission and the Council must provide strong support for the European textile industry to allow it to enter new markets .
I would ask that you , Mr President , and this House give full support for the release of the three <unk> and that you raise this immediately with the Council and the Commission to gain their support .
The letter was not , however , addressed to the Council and therefore it would not be appropriate for the Council to respond .
We will have succeeded when it is no longer needed , that is , when humanitarian aid has disappeared .
The electoral procedure did not ensure that the election or referendum were democratic , and what is more , electoral practices frequently did not comply with this procedure .
Before going on to talk to you as usual about the events that have taken place between two <unk> , I must remind you that today is the 60th anniversary of the creation of the United Nations .
In response to the repeated suggestions by the Commission , several ACP banana suppliers are changing their strategies and seeking more financial support to fund diversification where the banana industry is no longer sustainable .
In order to improve the funding conditions and , in particular , access to funding for small and medium-sized businesses , the capital risk action plan must be fully applied before the end of the year .

If asked to sum up in one word my view of the social Europe , I would say it was the Europe of employment .
If you were to travel to these regions , that would be your experience too .
The report is written as if it were a realistic assumption that as part of the engineering and the negotiations underlying the Cotonou Agreement we could easily have confronted and changed many of the underlying global issues .
Nevertheless , we know that in many cases the experience has not been especially encouraging .
For that reason , I urge Members to reject the two amendments .
What has been decided relates to limiting the presence of Member States &apos; representatives in cultural events in Cuba .
Their work has been welcomed by many speakers tonight , a sign that his work is welcomed by almost everyone .
Are we aware that we need a <unk> call here in Europe to understand that the <unk> and <unk> that is talked about in South East Asia could well come to Europe and elsewhere in the world ?
This , ladies and gentlemen , is about the fact that business on the Internet must be safe and that health information must be able to be <unk> on it <unk> .
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report .
At municipal , regional , national and Community level there are more and more regulations imposing endless obligations on people who want to set up such an activity , and you almost need the <unk> spirit of a <unk> century <unk> to launch into the adventure of setting up an SME in today &apos;s European Union .
We must offer them our utmost solidarity .
The current proposal is the first step towards achieving the necessary clarity , and I hope that the Council will support our proposals .
Rio was a milestone .
Parliament &apos;s Rules do not allow us to express these opinions in the way we once did .
They demonstrate that the Member States , Parliament and the Commission are serious about the long-term eradication of discrimination and racism .
Therefore , the Liberal motion before us today will not be supported by me , as its primary purpose is to <unk> the United States of American in its global war on terrorism .
I hope you will understand that I can support very few , because they no longer follow , in fact , they abandon the line which I presented in the Committee on Budgets and which was adopted by a majority in the committee .
Is the Commission satisfied with the progress of the Peace and Reconciliation Programme for Northern Ireland ?
The structural resources will be concentrated on the genuinely needy regions , especially by giving clear priority to Objective 1 regions and by continuing the Cohesion Fund .
It is what Commissioner Patten was talking about in relation to the Middle East this morning ; it is about avoiding a clash of <unk> .
What do you have in mind ?
<unk> waste is the final stage in the treatment of waste , due to the waste hierarchy , and the Commission will make strong efforts to reduce and <unk> waste and in its approach to an integrated product policy .
That is why it is very good that the Commission has indicated – indeed , Commissioner <unk> <unk> has been saying so to the German media – that bringing greater flexibility to the labour markets is the only way we in Europe can provide our people with more work , and that this , being a means whereby work is created , must not be a source of anxiety .
Secondly , it is not standards harmonised on a Europe-wide basis that we need , but Europe-wide minimum standards , particularly for video games and the Internet , in order to offer young people real protection .
To this extent the Dührkop report is an important stage on the difficult road to interinstitutional cooperation .
That will enable enlargement to strengthen rather than <unk> the links in the Community .
Once again , this is something which my staff will greatly appreciate and I am grateful to the Members for their comments .
The 1995 Declaration was a <unk> and much of it remains valid today .
We are giving our assent to an agreement which is necessary and worthwhile for Europe .
Thank you for the debate .
On the other hand it has been observed - and this cannot be denied - that the ceiling system actually <unk> those hauliers that try to adopt ecologically friendly procedures , as has been said , while instead encouraging bad practice , as you well know , and even fraudulent practices : for instance , many lorries go in with a bill of <unk> , <unk> in Austria and then leave , and so are not subject to the points clause .
Report ( <unk> / 2002 ) by <unk> <unk> McNally , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on adopting a multiannual programme for action in the field of energy : &apos; <unk> Energy for Europe &apos; Programme ( <unk> ) ( COM ( 2002 ) <unk> - <unk> / 2002 - 2002 / <unk> ( COD ) ) Transport and mobility are , today , crucial factors for the pricing of goods and services and it is , therefore , crucial that in no way do they constitute breaches of competition .
In a collective effort , the institutions of the European Union must therefore help prevent crises brought about by price increases .
The European Parliament is not the Council ’ s echo chamber .
The very extensive international safety regulations that today govern maritime transport have brought about a drastic reduction in accidents and pollution , and the measures we are debating today show the commitment of our institutions to enhancing vessel safety and the protection of the marine environment .
It does not make sense for various companies in three major EU Member States to work on the <unk> Air <unk> project , for example , in separate projects that have nothing to do with one another , and to <unk> earnings , as it were .
Economic and social progress must also lead to the consolidation of the areas of democracy , but , as has already been stressed , we must not lose sight of the fact that full respect for human rights is essential if the partnership is genuinely to succeed .
It is this responsibility that has led my group to request a separate vote on paragraphs 6 and 7 of the compromise resolution .
<unk> is not just a domestic issue .
<unk> results will emerge through development , democracy and prosperity .
In the final analysis , many remarks made in this meeting will also be of interest to Mrs <unk> Gorsel , but since she has reminded me of this question , which , as I have already said , I would have addressed at a later stage , let me just say that this is of course an issue pertaining to the internal market .
If such difficulties present themselves , I would make an appeal to you as President-designate of the Commission , Professor Prodi , please to make sure that difficulties do not become crises .
– Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to use this speech to welcome the progress made in the interinstitutional dialogue and the compromise which I believe has been reached .
I do not object ; I do not hold strong views on the subject and I certainly do not want to upset my good friend Mr <unk> , but there is a danger that we could create <unk> subjects and superior subjects .
We have to be cautious about taking on any new commitments , but , at the same time , we must stand by the commitments that we have made , once the countries fulfil the strict conditions for accession .
We have all enjoyed the discussions - sometimes very wide-ranging - we have had on it .
There was the Maastricht 3 % rule , which meant an automatic block on social issues .
We have noted Parliament &apos;s suggestion , in Paragraph 7 , on the <unk> of amending the regulations governing the financial instrument , the <unk> .
I would remind you of one of these measures : the ‘ Single Sky ’ initiative , which is going to mean a reduction in costs and better rotation of the fleet , the authorisation of alliances , the combating of distortions in competition conditions – specifically , the issue of support for our air companies in the face of <unk> or predatory practices on the part of third countries – and the support we have given them in relation to issues such as insurance when there have been difficulties in the past .
Méndez de Vigo / <unk> Report ( <unk> / 2001 ) The willingness of the rapporteur to do this was another factor that encouraged me to vote for the report .
Subject : <unk> of flax Does the Commission consider it reprehensible that <unk> officials at the Ministry of Agriculture should have encouraged practices reminiscent of <unk> hunting &apos; with regard to the cultivation of flax , promoted them through administrative channels , and received <unk> for themselves and their families as a result ?
.
A second product that warrants special attention in the light of trade and development , and which is often overlooked in the discussion of agriculture , is cotton .
The presidency has suggested that the European proposal should not go as far as requesting abolition of the death penalty but rather a moratorium on the use of this punishment .
I would like to rid certain people here of the <unk> that those who took the initiative for quorum counts are no longer present .
Mr President , I have an appeal to make to the EU Heads of State or Government when they meet in Brussels tomorrow and on Friday .
It seems then , that the rule of law prevails in Mexico .
.
Mr President , in its proposals to the Council of Ministers , the Commission has not set out the prices of products and subsidies , as it <unk> claims it has done ; in our opinion , it simply wants to remind us of the prices and subsidies which will be in force for the period from <unk> in accordance with existing regulations , and at the very most , to amend some monthly <unk> to the intervention prices of any products to which this system still applies .
I want to say once again that this is not a problem created by our staff , who work extremely hard , thin on the ground as they are .
The proposed directive on passenger registration will , I feel , remain a measure purely on record .
But I do not think we should only devote one year to this aim .
Does it want reform because of enlargement or because of the WTO ?
It is defined according to the subject of the research , which must be carried out at least at European level if it is to match up to world competition .
Mr President , I wish to support the Culture 2000 programme and congratulate the rapporteur , Mr <unk> <unk> <unk> , for having enriched the text as a whole with new contributions aimed , on the one hand , at achieving greater participation of countries and beneficiaries and , on the other , at emphasising the need to <unk> the grants , as well as recommendations in defence of the <unk> of activities and great cultural events .
I am optimistic , but such optimism depends upon maintaining the balance in the social model .
I am glad that the Mayer and Menrad reports were discussed together because this also underlines the fact that we are endeavouring to live out the social market economy and , rather than play social policy off against economic policy , consider these as complementary and common factors and establish a symbol of unity .
The Commission is now aware that the threat is real .
Poverty in the world is not on the decline , quite the opposite .
As Members of this House have stressed repeatedly , Tibetan <unk> are at particular risk .
Several pupils were seriously injured and are still undergoing treatment in hospital in <unk> and <unk> .
As happy as I am with the Commissioner &apos;s proposals , as <unk> as I am about the Barroso Commission as a whole , it is ridiculous to come up with a communication on oil without a single sentence on transport , when we all know that transport accounts for 70 % of oil consumption in Europe .
We retained the specific rule in the financial regulation in <unk> with a <unk> which we settled thus .
We quite rightly set up the WTO panel to deal with differences of interest , and I am not only referring to the interests of big countries but also to those of small countries such as Honduras , Guatemala , Mexico or <unk> , in this case - so that they can have a reference in order to be able to react to any disturbance to their markets , in particular in order to face up to the bigger countries .
It must do so again today .
Spain maintained its unity , it kept the Basque country and <unk> and Catalonia and it did well to do so , because no one identified Spain with <unk> and no one played around with Spain &apos; s unity in the name of a <unk> dictator .
That is why I have asked the ministers , since they have not given me any more money , to ensure that supplements to the Erasmus grants are offered in their countries , and this is something we are discussing .
The new system would also allow the measures to be adapted quickly , taking account of the specific features of these regions .
<unk> defending the rights of homosexuals are among the partners involved in this measure , and several initiatives have accordingly been taken , such as an information campaign and an effort to raise the public ’ s awareness of the forms of discrimination suffered by homosexuals .
At the same time , the rapporteur calls for the enforcement of a cooperative .
In a further attempt to adapt the fleet to the resources , the Commission has again forgotten that there are countries that have broadly complied with their objectives , and is presenting a global proposal which will punish everybody with the threat of new cuts in fleet size and the intention of <unk> aid for the modernisation of the fleet .
Europe has thus been able to respond to the legitimate aspirations of these people who have suffered so much under an ideology that , for forty years , refused to recognise their most basic rights .
However , I emphasise that the Council deplores any situation where human rights are not upheld .
I therefore welcome the fact that Mrs Bjerregaard has promised , in a letter to the rapporteur , that she will bring forward such a framework directive on the basis of the guidelines set out by the rapporteur , focusing on emission standards as the most appropriate instrument , combined with the principles of prevention , precaution and action at source .
The Economic and Social Committee also gave a favourable opinion on 29 October 1997 and the Council should take its final decision before the end of the first half of 1998 , during the British Presidency .
Moving on to the Ombudsman , the <unk> % implementation rate is of note .
We have seen the success of rural development programmes , including the LEADER scheme and other such activities which have helped create much needed employment in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas throughout Europe .
Such errors should therefore be classified separately from the substantial errors .
But all is not lost , for sooner or later , when the revolutionary forces come to power , a referendum will give a voice back to the people to confirm the <unk> of French law over the European treaties .
The principle of equality of opportunity and treatment between men and women is one of the philosophical foundations of our European Parliament .
After meeting her in prison in Ankara and at the time of her trial , I still remember a young woman of incredible strength and determination .
We have heard a number of stories of failed coordination which has hampered the effectiveness of that aid .
This is one of Europe &apos; s great opportunities , but digital television also plays an important role .
That is one of your core tasks as President of the Commission .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate all those involved in conciliation and achieving more for the Socrates Programme than some of us even dreamed was possible .
Despite these amendments , the objective remains the same .
I do not think we will be setting a very good example if we then fail to even discuss this issue !
I have to tell Commissioner Mandelson that this traditional attitude is a thing of the past ; today , you come to the table not with the power of military persuasion , but with ideology and the instrument of liberalisation , yet it will not work , for the countries of the developing world are now standing up for themselves , making their own interests visible and countering the intellectual property that we want to sell to them in the form of <unk> services with what is theirs culturally , socially and ecologically , along with the right to basic <unk> .
Have all the avenues been closed off whereby North Korea might be brought back to talk to the Six ?
This is the enemy which your CFSP has in its sights .
I hope that this approach will be addressed when we look at the situation <unk> all minorities .
Thirdly , we have ensured that only certain specific products may be used to manufacture gelatine and tallow , namely those which I have already described .
This is a free country , Mr <unk> .
If you want to enlarge the European Union , you have to make it fit for enlargement .
We are interested in having sound foundations so that we do not just <unk> from one problem to the next , but so that we can work together on a solid basis for years to come , because the problem in the Balkans is not a problem which can be solved in a year .
The answer , of course , is an emphatic no .
For that to happen , we need cooperation , ideas , people and capacities and those are the <unk> of the four main axes in the Framework Programme .
The other point is positive <unk> .
This is important in occupational training which <unk> people for making a professional contribution to society .
Mr President , Mrs Gebhardt , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to congratulate the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights and , more specifically , our colleague Mrs Gebhardt , for the excellent work that they have all done and the determination they showed during the conciliation procedure .
The indictment against the continuous violations of democracy and human rights perpetrated by the Iraqi regime .
Now that the good Commissioner is listening , I will continue .
The European Union has to be at the cutting edge , it has even been said this evening , but , as regards restoring the ozone <unk> in the <unk> , and similarly , controlling the greenhouse effect , the result cannot be measured on the basis of Europe &apos; s speed , but only by taking an overall view .
Watson report ( <unk> / 2001 ) Such arguments are insulting to all sponsors except the tobacco industry , who make enormous efforts to finance these competitions .
For both the <unk> and the <unk> EDF , Liberia was more or less out of the circuit .
The debate is closed .
Civil servants and politicians must always be aware that we have an impact on the ability of our companies to be profitable and to grow .
Obviously , the first type is the most common .
The fact is that the introduction of a <unk> is dependent on the interoperability of toll systems , which means that the technology must be available , and work , before we can start charging for the <unk> , and we all know how urgently we need the money .
For some twenty years now we have been unable to stop unemployment <unk> .
This phenomenon is mainly a result of the technical developments of <unk> and <unk> , which permit various types of infrastructure functioning independently of each other to transport various types of content .
If there are <unk> product companies that are incapable of distinguishing tens of thousands of tonnes of <unk> made from animal waste , oil and chemical products from real butter , how can consumers be expected to have any confidence in their ability to guarantee the quality of their own products ?
Yet I really feel we can achieve that goal , which we have been pursuing since the end of the 1960s , and I hope that the single currency will become the starting point for finally achieving political union .
Agricultural prices We are very well aware , though , that we do not have the resources for that and that we will focus solely on cross-border projects and the big priority projects .
In addition there have been European Investment Bank loans which , over the same period , came to 267 million ECU plus <unk> million ECU coming from the Member States .
If the State is now powerless and unable to regularly pay its officials , this is surely primarily because the Duma refused to adopt the tax code and buried the proposed tax system under a mountain of amendments .
Unless there is a material change in Mr Buttiglione &apos;s portfolio , we shall be obliged to vote against your Commission .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the European Commission for their lists of good intentions , which I am sure they will do everything to implement .
<unk> ! &apos;
They will hopefully be concluded by April .
<unk> and practical rules are essential because there are fifteen countries , each with its own problems and in some countries - in my own , to be precise - in which responsibilities for control in this field lie with the <unk> autonomous governments .
We are also restricted by the GATT agreements within the framework of the WTO because , as a result of a major political error , unlike agricultural products , fishery products have always been consolidated under the GATT .
That was echoed by the words of the Commissioner immediately following my contribution .
The second important point is that you have been asked to examine a text which has not been prepared by a group of experts or a group of wise men , but which has been drafted by <unk> Members of the Convention , without any options .
However , I would like to emphasise some of the elements of the debate which may be very useful for the purposes of today &apos; s debate .
The drugs problem is world-wide .
We will also be undertaking evaluations on the subjects of employment , the environment , equal opportunities and support for SMEs in response to your wishes and I hope that the evaluation methods will gradually improve both in the Member States and in the Community .
So I firmly support Mr <unk> &apos; s justified criticism !
It is all too easy to pay <unk> service to human rights .
Structural aid for the rural economy , which was developed in <unk> , was also intended to provide compensation for the agricultural interests which were sacrificed within the framework of the GATT negotiations .
One important point that we wish to emphasise is the Commission ’ s acceptance that new agencies should be established <unk> and <unk> .
We must be tougher in our demands for progress in the direction set in Doha , in order to bring about greater openness in the markets , which will stimulate world trade .
That is especially important if our fellow MEPs from the new Member States are to receive reasonable salaries and if the earnings gap is to be reduced between those who earn least and those who earn most .
In this way we can discourage repetition in future .
We need systems to <unk> out pornography , and also racist and violent content ; I should like to see these particular filters for adults , too .
It is gratifying that the European Economic and Trade Office has been set up in Taiwan , something which I think indicates that the EU wants to see increased cooperation .
Secondly , Mr Pittella who , as a new member , came to the committee and has made quite a significant point about the <unk> of the ECSC funds .
I am very <unk> to be a member of Parliament ’ s delegation to that review conference .
However , I simply cannot understand why the Council did not accept Parliament &apos;s formulations on one matter , and that was the derogations for farmers .
We have already agreed this in the case of the electronic and electrical waste directive .
It would also be important to have a European day against human trafficking .
Because we now need to do more and better with the available resources – which seems to be the theme for today – I therefore call on the Commission to get the allocation of the scarce resources right and to invest in projects based on the fundamental principles of lasting peace and regional stability , respect for human rights and democracy , and sustainable development .
The <unk> amount of work placed on those in the field means that the EU &apos;s money is not accurately and fully <unk> .
I will leave it for others to judge whether they merit that description .
I hope that everyone can contribute to such a solution .
The euro has proved its worth even before its actual introduction .
We have also made a conscious effort to get young candidates onto the list .
Our determination has enabled the Community preferential arrangements and aid to Union producers , who have long been in line with social and environmental standards , to be respected .
The signatories have frequently requested that the applicants for membership submit plans and programmes in which precise time schemes and goals for the bringing into force of the individual items of legislation are indicated .
.
Mr President , having lived most of my life under Communist rule , the rules we are enforcing in the ‘ Television without <unk> ’ Directive sound all too familiar to me .
Although slavery was officially abolished fifty years ago , it continues to exist in all kinds of forms : people are <unk> and sold like commodities , are employed in forced labour , receive very little pay and are <unk> in their freedom of movement .
They are all fine ideas , but fine ideas with no money to back them up are nothing but empty promises .
The Commission proposes to consolidate and modernise the present procurement directives .
How can we refuse others what we granted ourselves after the war , to reconstruct our industry , agriculture and economy ?
Why , therefore , do we not have legislation which identifies what integrated production is by means of a quality mark ?
To conclude , what we are trying to do is to ensure that the EU maintains its position as the world leader in mobile telephony .
Unfortunately this is all too true , but we must guard this stable door effectively now .
.
Madam President , allow me to say how <unk> it is to see you in this position .
We are left with Article 11 ( 1 ) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States .
Finally , a constitution <unk> who is responsible for what .
Unfortunately , he has not kept this promise .
It has been proposed that financial instruments be organised alongside those of the nation states , and that is something we cannot do without , but it is equally clear that people like Europeans , from a highly mobile society , cannot do without <unk> help in such a situation .
Given the fact that the final decision on <unk> has not been taken yet , the flexibility in <unk> funds between <unk> and other fusion activities is an important element of the proposal .
Those arguing that such an action should take place would have to consider the undesirable consequences arising from it .
At any rate , the ECU <unk> m under the old programme were well invested between 1992 and 1996 in projects involving 16 international transport axes - incentives which allowed demand to grow .
No wonder they are not <unk> at the chance to become involved with the International Criminal Court .
I ask this , in particular , because a series of recent food scandals , from mad cow disease to dioxin in chickens , has shown that food safety and the quest for profit are a contradiction in terms .
Today , it is a reform of the CAP and Community trade policy and therefore , implicitly , the fisheries policy .
Resumption of the session The Swedish Conservatives have today chosen to abstain in the vote on the Citizens for Europe report .
I am glad that we can debate the matter properly here and I thank the rapporteur for his detailed report .
And my fifth point is that we finally need to return to disarmament .
Mr President , the atmosphere has changed significantly since the visit of George <unk> Bush to Brussels a few months ago , but it is interesting that in the international press this is not yet recognised .
The public service broadcasters are our guarantee of free communication , of high quality , accessible to all , and respecting cultural diversity .
But this <unk> approach means that passengers are running growing risks .
Nevertheless , can I ask you to confirm that it is quite inappropriate for Members of this House - Liberals or otherwise - to seek to persuade you to hear them .
Obviously , some operators are driven to resort to longer buses by the <unk> of competition .
<unk> from my constituency believe that industrial fishing is one of the main causes of this state of affairs : both because the smaller fish on which they feed are being taken in huge quantities and because the <unk> themselves are being caught in the very small <unk> nets necessary for industrial fishing , as indeed are <unk> <unk> cod .
Let me conclude with one comment .
That is the reason .
However , the Presidency hopes that Mr <unk> will soon return to the European Parliament for further discussions .
Some complex questions , such as deposit guarantee schemes or the issue of <unk> of last resort , must be <unk> in that context .
To the traceability of the animal , it would be appropriate , Madam President , to add the guarantee that the animal has always been fed on grass or cereals .
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves .
It is there that the new challenge lies following the failure of Lisbon .
I have no more to say on the subject , save to pay tribute to my officials who have tried to implement a difficult policy honestly , transparently and with integrity .
Mr President , I rise to speak in place of my colleague and fellow member of the Petitions Committee Mr <unk> , who is , regrettably , unable to be present .
I see the focus on health education and food security in our programme in Angola as something which will be useful for precisely this endeavour .
My question to you is : has the Bureau looked into this matter yet ?
On the other hand , being obliged to use it and still having to wait minutes on end to get out , I do not see the reasons for this .
I am fully aware that the Vietnam debate is historically charged .
I voted for the report which approves the entry of the Slovak Republic into the European Union too , and I hope that the next European Parliament , elected in 2004 , will include at least one representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party of the Slovak Republic , so that there will be more of us to protect the interests of the elderly throughout Europe .
The position of <unk> in some countries , for example , needs to be addressed , and here we hope to see practical improvements .
It can become a larger and stronger political entity if we get on with the homework that now awaits us .
At the same time , an optimistic atmosphere prevailed in Africa , because Africa had far greater resources than the Asian countries .
Thus far , its response has been promising .
In addition , paragraph 11 of the report welcoming the commitment by the European Central Bank to the ratification of the so-called European Constitution is an insult , given that it was recently voted down by the peoples of France and the Netherlands .
In summary , an agreed overall solution between all institutions is within reach if the European Parliament tomorrow accepts Amendments Nos 9 , 13 , 18 , 25 , 26 , 28 , 37 , 38 and 44 to 50 .
As unemployment appears during structural reforms , support is needed , but one cannot devote all one &apos;s attention to support alone , as otherwise the budget cannot be sustained .
Subject : Measures to protect chocolate As part of its policy to ensure the quality of agricultural products and foodstuffs , the Union has set up a system to protect traditional products of specific character , under which chocolate is eligible for recognition .
As your report makes clear , there is an urgent need to review both the organization and the functioning of the Commission &apos;s services and , more generally , the system for preparing and taking decisions .
I have also been thinking about other matters .
It always seems to be a matter of <unk> , we may have had some irregularities , there may have been some <unk> of fraud but we do not have to pay all the money back &apos; .
Either way , the operators and the regulatory authorities have a duty to see proper financial provision is made for the costs of decommissioning .
We held meetings with members of the <unk> Government , with parliamentary leaders , with the President of Congress , and with President Lula &apos;s principal <unk> , and we realised once again that we are dealing here with an extraordinary country , which is setting in motion an exemplary social inclusion programme , which will be crucial to its future .
EURES has an important role for them and it is a great pity that employment and employers &apos; organisations are not more involved in the development of these services .
However , to focus on the European Union as it is today , and on the subject of government and governance - a word which , at least in Spanish , brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs , although it may be an appropriate word anyway - , the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government , and , since President Prodi always <unk> his home town , Bologna , I would advise him to go to <unk> for a while and see something which we all understand : the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which speak of <unk> <unk> &#91; good government &#93; and <unk> <unk> &#91; bad government &#93; .
The next item is the Council statement on the annual report on human rights followed by a debate .
The Council should be aware of the fact that a new level of cooperation now exists between the two bodies responsible for budgetary matters .
I am sure that none of us here will object to fraud and tax evasion being tackled but I must say that it is necessary to maintain the confidence of citizens in the Union , and I think that many Member State governments will be wishing to look very carefully at any extension of <unk> before agreeing to it .
Any attempt to explain life in the community of <unk> in the <unk> of England to the rest of the European Union and beyond without mentioning <unk> would give a very false impression of the importance of <unk> to that city and , indeed , to the motor car industry within the European Union .
This new programme <unk> various objectives .
I hope the European Commission will consider using this report as the basis for what could be called &apos;the first European action plan on dementia &apos; .
All that remains is for me to express my <unk> appreciation of all citizens and governments who have , so <unk> and <unk> , contributed towards financing humanitarian actions to help the devastated peoples .
The current difficulties and limitations of the system of excise duty and VAT , necessarily geared towards harmonisation among the Member States , must be overcome so that a real single market can be launched .
Following Portugal &apos; s <unk> Revolution &apos; , when I arrived for the first time at the United Nations in 1974 as Minister for Foreign Affairs , the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs said to me , &apos; <unk> careful , do not <unk> <unk> , because <unk> is not a <unk> and never has been . &apos;
Mr President , if the failure of Seattle really were to lead to a standstill or slow down the trade integration processes at global level , it would be a disaster .
In France these small companies , which number 800 000 , are currently the best job <unk> .
Like you , we are in favour of having transmission obligations .
Denmark will no doubt benefit from a successful start to the third stage of EMU .
In fact Parliament &apos;s support for and contribution to the reform has been crucial .
Today , I am disappointed by the poor results achieved .
Mr President , Commissioner , please excuse me for not being present when you called my question .
We heard Mr Santer &apos;s commitment to carrying through the requests in the motion for a resolution .
Secondly , these agreements can provide an opportunity for both parties to improve their respective procedures and even their legislation .
In other words , if a general obligation is defined , the States can do what they want , and essentially place a ceiling on compensation payments paid to workers .
However , we firmly believe that the European Regional Development Fund should be phased out and the money returned to the Member States .
To my mind , the greatest inadequacy of the Council &apos;s common position is the lack of sufficient control in implementing the indicative limit values .
This is taken up in the Souchet report and my own , with specific reference , in both cases , to Community action in the context of international organizations defining future changes in international maritime law .
Far , too , from filling the <unk> of the people who live there , it has driven them into debt and has failed to solve the problem of famine .
The first type covers two activity reports : one from the <unk> Committee on Safety , <unk> and Health Protection at Work , and the other from the Safety and Health Commission for the <unk> and Other <unk> <unk> .
They are exempt from basic training , which prevents them from becoming unemployed and are only obliged to undergo further training every five years .
Perhaps I should try to take the wind out of the <unk> &apos; <unk> .
Even though we have to admit that a number of points have been taken on board , matters are as unsatisfactory as ever they were .
Europe is not at the moment at a disadvantage but the situation is moving rapidly .
It says that the funding was increased in 1996 , that the Commission presented proposals to the Florence European Council for the funding of the 14 priority projects , and that the preliminary draft budget for 1997 provides for an increase in the appropriations for the trans-European networks .
This is nothing new !
We are only too aware of the consequences this has on women &apos;s health .
This is essentially a new approach , one that requires constant emphasis .
This European Union is about a vision for the future .
It is highly hypocritical that the nine old Member States who are not lifting their restrictions are allowing the entry of workforce from non-European Union countries , but refuse to allow entry to workers from the new Member States .
Finally , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her stimulating report and to stress the Commission &apos;s determination to maintain its efforts to overcome the problems faced by frontier workers .
Why is that not so in the case of the Structural Funds ?
I have to say that I was not totally satisfied by the Commissioners &apos; responses , in that the documents that were referred to , with which we are familiar , as Mr Pronk said , need to contain time frames and rather more practical decision .
The patent recently issued to the University of Edinburgh poses the problem of the status of the <unk> and how to control it .
The study was carried out under the very clear influence of industrial groups , car manufacturers and oil <unk> , and , as such , there cannot be much technical confidence in the measures proposed in it .
I therefore feel that the matter should be examined in full .
This increase in miles <unk> the profit gained from using an economical and clean engine .
Perhaps your lack of interest in our Parliament , not to say your <unk> , <unk> from the fact that you have never been a Member of Parliament , you have never been elected , which means the people have never given you any mandate .
We represent the citizens and it is very useful that we are all in agreement .
<unk> , when Spain stopped looking towards Europe , she turned in upon herself and became <unk> , and a long process of civil conflicts began , creating the image of the two <unk> in the eyes of the world .
In your opinion , how many unnecessary administrative obstacles are there in EU regulations ?
In conclusion , the Commission accepts the new recital 3 , and I hope that this directive can now be finalised .
The Budgets Council did not , therefore , make its decisions exclusively on the basis of the priorities set by the Council ; it also took into account the budgetary principles I have just outlined .
When there is this level of organisation , it is no longer simply a question of combating illegal immigration , but of properly fighting crime itself .
President-in-Office of the Council , do you consider it appropriate to adopt measures to prevent sexual harassment in the <unk> <unk> ?
It is more than airlines : the European tourism industry is Europe &apos;s biggest industry , and the World <unk> and Tourism Council estimates at the present time that two million jobs could be lost in Europe .
All this is <unk> advice .
Mr President , all instances of racism and xenophobia , both old and new , are utterly <unk> , as we all agree .
When they meet for negotiations next week , the agricultural ministers will hopefully realise that a poor decision , or no decision at all , may in actual fact lead to a disaster for farmers , the countryside and also consumers who want to see good food in Europe .
There is a legal basis for industry , but there is no legal basis for tourism which , in a few years &apos; time , will be the most important sector in industry .
Let me also point out that the results of the process of transformation that we have already seen in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have varied to a wide degree .
Then you <unk> find we &apos;re on your side !
These issues have nothing to do with the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol into Community law .
If everyone is clear what foundations we are working from , then enterprises will have a smaller administrative burden and governments will not need to compete for rates indiscriminately .
The red tape here is minimal .
Furthermore , I believe it would be just as wrong to present compliance with the Stability Pact objectives as being a sufficient or , worse still , the only possible reaction to a context with a clear risk of recession .
Nevertheless , the West , the International Monetary Fund , the European Union and G7 continued to support to the so-called <unk> &apos; which showed signs of inefficiency for years , though these went <unk> by the West , <unk> by <unk> fundamentalism .
<unk> / 97 by Mr <unk> , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on : I. the recommendation for second reading on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a Council Regulation on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies ( <unk> / <unk> / <unk> ( SYN ) ) and II .
the report on the proposal for a Council regulation on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure ( <unk> / 2 / 97 - <unk> / 96-96 / <unk> ( CNS ) ) and - <unk> / 97 by Mrs Randzio-Plath , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , on the economic policy of the Member States of the Community ( COM ( 97 ) <unk> - <unk> / 97 ) If the institutions are to be successfully reformed , which is vital if our citizens are to have confidence in the way in which they are run , it is a problem , as Mr Blak has said , that nobody seems to wish to take responsibility .
At the moment , the sums we failed to get from the third package are equal to half the money which my country spends on education and health .
The human rights included in the Charter are powerful ones .
In this light , I would like to reopen the debate on corporate governance to discuss the wider concept of the company as stakeholders society , including the role of both sides of industry and all parties involved .
However , since he is not here , the question lapses .
The joint debate is closed .
We should instead carry on talking .
We need a permanent solution .
It is also unfair to accuse Members , who genuinely believe that the legal basis for this proposal is wrong , of being under the control of cigarette manufacturers .
Sometimes travellers need additional support and perhaps more support than the local population .
It also calls for a specific action programme , with effect from the 2005 budget .
Because many pensioners are worried and cannot sleep either .
That is what led the Commission to propose , in September 1997 , a legislative framework , based on Article 95 of the Treaty , with the aim of harmonising the procedures applying to <unk> trials in the European Union .
We must , however , make sure that the rules are designed in such a way as to provide adequate protection against the spread of <unk> to , in the first place , areas that are free of the disease .
Human dignity , respect for animals and plants within God &apos;s creation remain important issues to discuss .
The first stage of that process will , as indicated in the report , be a formal consultation of the social partners .
It is therefore possible to find a substantial sum of money for the Balkans without revising the financial perspectives .
There can be no point in sending young <unk> Europeans to developing countries , especially those experiencing catastrophic circumstances , just to help Europe &apos;s unemployment figures .
These requirements will be subject to mutual evaluation by the Member States and the Commission .
They were among 49 passengers denied <unk> because of airline regulations on crew shortage after a crew member had to be taken to hospital .
I wish to begin by giving special thanks to Karl von Wogau for his involvement in this process over the last 22 years .
The result is reasonably good .
– Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , at this late hour , I shall begin with a story about a driver who asks the price of a drop of petrol at a petrol station .
Some charges have been brought , which the Danish police have investigated .
Looking objectively at the text which is now before us , I think it tries to strike a fair balance between those who wish to go further and those who oppose any research whatsoever , between the technical and the ethical .
We must , of course , ask ourselves the question : what does accession cost ?
The reform of the common agricultural policy is very controversial .
That concludes Question Time .
An examination of the official documents shows an inconsistency and a lack of coordination of many Community policies with regard to the objective to strengthen cohesion .
A Member of this House did so referring to the situation in the Basque country .
In Eurodac , almost ten years later , we have an instrument that makes possible the clear identification of asylum-seekers and also of illegal immigrants .
That is , after all , the aim of the directive : to identify procedures which ensure a high degree of safety , while at the same time avoiding imposing an unnecessary burden of bureaucracy on the industry concerned .
Here too , I am repeating myself and merely saying what has already been said , but we must again lay stress on one fact .
The Presidency endeavoured to learn the lessons of this crisis and take a long hard look at the future .
The Commission should simply accept the amendments and proceed accordingly .
My primary objective has been to ensure that there is value for money for the European taxpayer and a desire to maintain the reputation and the dignity of this House in the eyes of the European public .
<unk> should not be able to use such substances as part of temporary additives to animal feed .
The goal , although perhaps too <unk> defined , is the right one .
Mr <unk> spoke about the French lorry blockade , UK <unk> farmers and the problems in Ireland .
I live in the middle of the forest in Sweden and should scarcely dare come home at all if some <unk> <unk> had got the idea that I had banned <unk> hunting .
Anyway , the European Union must do whatever is possible from a political and community point of view , and the resolution bears witness to this .
That happens far too little at the moment .
It also comes at a time when many Members of the House were giving favourable consideration to extending the Cotonou Convention to include Cuba .
Today , in Parliament , about 2 % of Members may not speak their mother tongue .
A budget geared towards development is therefore extremely important for the common European future .
Those are two quite simple objectives .
There is no intrinsic value in this .
Those are concepts that unite the Member States of the European Union .
I would therefore ask the President-in-Office once again to consider whether we should not meet the wishes of the opposition in Burma and introduce sanctions against the illegal junta which is now occupying the government .
This does not mean <unk> the importance of EU enlargement and the stabilisation of the Balkans ; it simply means that the Rio process must not suffer the same fate as the Barcelona process or the policies on the Mediterranean .
By the way - and I am sure even you have got wind of this - the Austrian Presidency seems to have acquired the kind of reputation that goes with the <unk> , ‘ the <unk> meal ’ .
It even insisted on the implementation of the education agreement concluded between Mr Milosevic and Mr <unk> without delay .
In the United States , there were plans to apply certain filters , but these blocked all the information on breast cancer , for example , because the word ‘ breast ’ was banned as <unk> and all the information on it was filtered out .
I want to state resolutely and unequivocally that we consider cooperation with the <unk> to be in the interest of all of us living in what was once Yugoslavia .
In the meantime , however , the experience of , and the lessons learned to date from , <unk> II are being actively considered by the Commission in the context of a review of its overall strategy in this field .
It was then a country with huge energy shortages , tremendous <unk> , Soviet troops still on its soil and tremendous insecurity .
We need to work with the United States to make that a reality .
I agree that third countries should set their own health rules but we should not approve of double standards .
To conclude , Mr President , I wish to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the results it has achieved , on the compromise reached between Council and Parliament , in which the Commission played a part and which should , we hope , enable this dossier to be concluded at first reading .
The compromise on <unk> is realistic giving a <unk> breathing space before a full ban would be introduced .
Similarly , controlling the activities of EU armaments companies will inevitably be compromised by the uncontrolled licensing of production outside the EU .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , well , those of you who are still here , I think that as we are amongst experts , there are only a few key points to make about the budget for Parliament for the year 2000 .
( IT ) Mr President , the oral amendment seeks to replace the word &quot; qualification &quot; , the last word in the amendment , with the word &quot; expertise &quot; .
This report says , for instance , that parents with children in <unk> are people with reduced mobility .
We have tabled a number of amendments , and if , as I really believe will be the case , it is not possible for these to be supported by Parliament , we shall find it difficult to support the report as a whole .
The European Union does indeed have such an advantage , compared , for example , with NATO .
Such awareness is understandable within the European Union and it is therefore important to have this opportunity to put forward suggestions aimed at preventing it from occurring .
I am also stepping up monitoring activities in the field of media pluralism and will shortly publish a working paper on that issue .
I presume we are expected to work out the Council &apos;s view on these matters by some form of <unk> .
I do not think I have ever come across such a fine exercise in <unk> in a public document .
Despite that , what do you see as our options for improving the competitiveness of European industry so that it can continue to be successful on the international market ?
Question No 3 by ( <unk> / 99 ) : The delegation has voted in favour of the bloc vote on 28 amendments .
Anyone reading the ICAT protocols of the past few years will come to the sad conclusion that it is the EU Member States with large fleets in the Atlantic that are <unk> a preventive approach in the ICAT committees by <unk> any decisions on more stringent management measures to protect young fish .
I think that the Commission will have achieved something very commendable if it moves in that direction and if it considers it appropriate , as seems to me quite apparent , to seek the cooperation of all of the associations in that category , in an effort to collect the most wide-ranging and detailed documentation possible .
At the same time , however , long-standing prejudices and ideas about the participation of women in the creation and development of our society must be swept aside .
It emphasises the need for personal responsibility as well as economic responsibility at lower levels of the official machinery .
We are not in a position to make a judgment from our own knowledge and experience , and as Mr Patten has just said , we have agreed that the International Criminal Tribunal will be the <unk> on this issue and we do have a clear picture at present .
The Commission has demonstrated its concern about this matter in the report .
We shall nonetheless be voting against the report as a whole in the light of the subsidiarity principle .
In the present situation it is crucial that the European Union and the international community leave no doubt about their resolve .
To close , what is really important , and I take it on board and will promote it in the Commission , is the question of collating data , really accurate data which will give us the real dimension of the difference between the sexes in the health sector ; this will of course help both us and the Member States to plan the rest of our strategy .
Nevertheless , every opportunity should be taken for bilateral and <unk> talks .
We have here a well-balanced , excellent report on a subject which , together with the directive on <unk> cars and <unk> drafted earlier by Mr Florenz , will from now on serve as a model for other similar legislation .
But do you not think it would be a very good thing if the brain had a body , and arms and legs ?
So , from one member of a group of one to another member of a group of one , let me say : congratulations .
The transparency of the aid redistribution procedures must also be increased .
Therefore , even if an agreement is not reached with the Council , could you explain to me how it is that there is a risk of certain organisations not having funding ?
The Commission is nonetheless aware of the fact that legislative action must be backed up by other initiatives aimed at combating de facto discrimination , humiliating practices , prejudice and <unk> .
We have to show them that enlargement will bring much greater benefits for everyone .
The debate is closed .
Not least , dialogue with and support for those countries from which the immigrants come and those through which they pass on their way to Europe are absolutely essential for any lasting , effective solution .
We need to restore the competitiveness of the railway system , which is possible in the light of the analysis proposed , but naturally we cannot just consider the railway system and railway transportation ; we also need to take other means into account , the role this competitiveness can play in trade and in combined transportation and , naturally , how the various means of transport are integrated .
After listening to all the statements it is clear that there is a wide variety of opinion in Parliament .
The debate is closed .
We ask Europe to become more involved .
I would like to say to the rapporteur that he is absolutely right , that the effectiveness of all these measures will be assessed according to the Member States &apos; capacity for control in their various areas of responsibility .
What I am getting at is that it would not only be wrong to express a desire to lift the arms embargo , but that it is also wrong to say at all that there is at present any question of doing so .
The credibility of the European Union is , of course , vital .
Amendment No 12 seeks to introduce a specific definition of credit .
I would like to repeat that we have not stopped aid to the Palestinian people , as some have said .
I have asked for environmental and sustainable development targets to be properly taken into consideration , and for access of SMEs to new communications and information technologies to be promoted .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is faced with a real operational problem .
But it is certainly not going to help <unk> jobs in coal and steel .
Like all those MEPs on the list to ask questions I was at least expecting a written answer immediately afterwards .
Apart from cheap loans , which the Commissioner has already mentioned , I think we need to do more to ensure the money flows quickly .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , although we support the majority of the 2002 budget guidelines , namely those that give priority to food safety and the BSE crisis and some general measures on immigration , unfortunately , the resolution is guilty of abuses that our group cannot accept because they are detrimental to the interests of farmers .
With regard to the preparation of the Barcelona European Council , specific action needs to be taken before the end of the year - we must establish the Food Safety Agency , make progress on Community patents , reach agreement on cross-border payments in euro and on public contracts , as well as implement the Galileo project .
The next item is the report ( <unk> / 2003 ) by Robert J. E. Evans , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , concerning the prevention and control of trafficking in human organs and tissues .
I have not read this morning &apos; s papers yet , but I believe I can make a sincere case to promote French beef in general .
I am sure that the Italian Presidency will do its utmost to keep this region at the top of the Union &apos;s priorities .
This concern also meets with the approval of the Group of Socialist MEPs , who have therefore voted in favour of the report , although they have substantial reservations about the statements made under item 8 . .
– Mr President , the construction of trans-European transport and energy networks is of enormous significance for the EU , and in particular for the 10 new Member States .
It was high time provision was made for bringing into line national laws dealing with legal guarantee systems ( as opposed to commercial guarantees ) in connection with contracts of sale concluded with consumers .
Secondly .
– Mr President , it is lamentable that the suffering of the people of Zimbabwe is turning into a never-ending story .
That is why the Commission will , this very afternoon , set up a special committee on risk capital , with a view to the 1998 Cardiff European Council , which will , therefore , play a fully complementary role .
Nevertheless , both the rationale underlying the organisation of these summits and the views of many of the peaceful demonstrators remain current .
It is important to establish transparency for consumers where such a mark is concerned .
And we need to tell them as much again and again .
Lastly , I should like to thank Mrs Gebhardt again for the work she has done .
